javac -verbose -d . *.java  
-d specifies where to put the class files
# create the jar file
We first create a text file named Manifest.txt with the following contents:

Main-Class: mypack.JdbcAllTests
Class-Path: mssql-jdbc-11.2.0.jre11.jar

Warning: The text file must end with a new line or carriage return. The last line will not be parsed properly if it does not end with a new line or carriage return.
We then create a JAR file named MyJar.jar by entering the following command:

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/manifestindex.html

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/modman.html

The basic command has this format:

jar cfm jar-file manifest-addition input-file(s)
Let's look at the options and arguments used in this command:

The c option indicates that you want to create a JAR file.
The m option indicates that you want to merge information from an existing file into the manifest file of the JAR file you're creating.
The f option indicates that you want the output to go to a file (the JAR file you're creating) rather than to standard output.
manifest-addition is the name (or path and name) of the existing text file whose contents you want to add to the contents of JAR file's manifest.
jar-file is the name that you want the resulting JAR file to have.
The input-file(s) argument is a space-separated list of one or more files that you want to be placed in your JAR file.
The m and f options must be in the same order as the corresponding arguments.

jar cvfm JdbcAllTests.jar manifest.txt java/tutorial/mssql/*.class

jar cvfm JdbcAllTests.jar manifest.txt mypack/*.class
jar cvfm JdbcAllTests.jar manifest.txt mypack/java/tutorial/mssql/*.class

You can directly invoke this application by running the following command:
Note: make sure the class files used by the program are specified in the Class-Path of the manifest.txt file.
java -jar JdbcAllTests.jar
java -cp ./mssql-jdbc-11.2.0.jre11.jar:. MssqlExample.jar
java -cp ./mssql-jdbc-11.2.0.jre11.jar -jar JdbcToolBossConnection.jar


java -cp ./mssql-jdbc-11.2.0.jre11.jar:. mypack.JdbcToolBossConnection

pushd ~/src/linux-utils/java/tutorial/simple
javac -d . Simple.java -cp ~/src/linux-utils/java/tutorial/simple
Run
# we can just run it
java -cp ~/src/linux-utils/java/tutorial/simple tutorial.simple/Simple
# or we can create a jar file to run
jar cvfm Simple.jar simple-manifest.txt tutorial/simple/Simple.class
# run app from jar file
You can directly invoke this application by running the following command:
Note: make sure the class files used by the program are specified in the Class-Path of the manifest.txt file.
java -cp ./mssql-jdbc-11.2.0.jre11.jar -jar Simple.jar

java -jar simple.jar
java -cp ./mssql-jdbc-11.2.0.jre11.jar:. Simple.jar
