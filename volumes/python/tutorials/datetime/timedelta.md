# **[]()**

A Python timedelta object, found within the datetime module, represents a duration or the difference between two dates or times. It is used to express a span of time, such as 5 days, 3 hours, or 10 minutes and 30 seconds

Key characteristics of timedelta objects:

- **Representation of duration:** Unlike datetime objects which represent specific points in time, timedelta objects represent a length of time.
- **Creation:** You can create a timedelta object by passing keyword arguments like days, seconds, microseconds, milliseconds, minutes, hours, and weeks to the datetime.timedelta() constructor. All arguments are optional and default to 0.
