# **[concat](https://builtin.com/articles/pandas-concat)**

Are you feeling overwhelmed by data scattered across a million spreadsheets? You’re not alone. Whether you’re a coding rookie or a seasoned developer, understanding pandas.concat() is like adding a superpower to your Python toolkit — but let’s start at the beginning.

Pandas, a powerful, open-source library built on top of the Python programming language, helps you handle, analyze, and visualize data efficiently. The pandas.concat() function concatenates and combines multiple DataFrames or Series into a single, unified DataFrame or Series.

Its flexibility and efficiency make it a valuable tool for anyone working with data analysis and manipulation in Python. The key to using pandas.concat() lies in understanding your data and using the appropriate join options to create a meaningful and accurate combined dataset.

So, no matter if you’re a data newbie feeling lost in the Python jungle or a seasoned analyst swamped in siloed information, this guide is your fast track to data harmony.

Let’s break down the function, looking into the values it can return, examples of its use, and alternative functions. Time to dive in.

Pandas.concat() Function Syntax
The basic syntax for the concat() function within a Python script is:

```python
pandas.concat(objs, *, axis=0, join='outer', ignore_index=False,
keys=None, levels=None, names=None, verify_integrity=False,
sort=False, copy=None)
```

Pandas concat() Parameters

- objs: This is the sequence or mapping of Series or DataFrame objects you want to concatenate.
- axis: This specifies the axis along which the concatenation will occur. By default, it is set to zero, which means concatenation along rows. If you want to concatenate along columns, you can adjust this setting.
- join: This specifies how to handle the overlapping labels along the specified axis. It can take values like “outer” (default), “inner,” “left,” or “right.”\
- keys: This parameter lets you build a hierarchical index in either a sequence or mapping.
- levels: This lets you configure the levels that make up the resulting hierarchical index.
- names: This provides names for the levels generated.
- verify_integrity: If True, it checks whether the new concatenated axis contains duplicates. If it does, it raises a ValueError. The default is False, however.
- sort: If True, it sorts the resulting DataFrame or Series by the keys.
copy: If set to False, it avoids copying data unnecessarily.
- ignore_index: If set to True, it will reset the resulting object's index, but the default value is False.

## Pandas concat() Default Values

axis: 0
join: 'outer'
ignore_index: False
verify_integrity: False
sort: False
copy: None

## When to Use the Pandas.concat() Function

Put simply, users employ the concat() function in the Pandas library when there’s a need to concatenate two or more Pandas objects along a particular axis, meaning either rows or columns. And there are various circumstances when the concat() function comes in handy. Here are some examples.

- Building comprehensive data sets: Say you’ve got data scattered across different sources and want to create a complete data set. Concatenating allows you to merge these data sets, creating a unified and holistic view of your information.
- Time-series data: Users can easily concatenate DataFrames with chronological information, ensuring a smooth flow of time-related insights.
- Handling missing data: When dealing with missing data, the concat() function lets you cleverly fill in the gaps, combining DataFrames with complementary information to create a more complete data set.

Although pandas.concat() is a fantastic function, there are some circumstances in which it isn’t ideal. For instance, concatenating massive DataFrames can be resource-intensive; users should consider alternative approaches like merging or appending if performance is critical.

Furthermore, users must ensure their DataFrames or Series have compatible columns and data types before concatenating, as mismatched data can lead to errors or inaccurate results.

Pandas.concat() Examples
Now, let’s look at some examples of pandas.concat() in practice.

1. pandas.concat() to Concatenate Two DataFrames
For example, imagine you work for a real estate agency, and you have two DataFrames:

- DataFrame One contains information about listed properties, including address, price, square footage, number of bedrooms, and amenities.
- DataFrame Two records past sales transactions, including the sale price, date, address, and property type.

Concatenating these DataFrames and developing a rich data set can help you predict property values, identify market trends, and analyze buyer preferences.  

Here’s an example showing before and after concatenating two DataFrames: concat0.py

This example shows how concatenating seemingly separate data sets can unlock valuable insights and optimize your decision-making in a real-world business context.

2. pandas.concat() To Join Two DataFrames
The join parameter lets you configure the handling of overlapping columns during DataFrame concatenation.

For instance, one DataFrame could include customer information like names and emails, and another with their purchase history, including product IDs and prices. You can use concat() to combine them, creating a single DataFrame with all relevant customer data for personalized recommendations or marketing campaigns.

Here’s an example to illustrate the use of the join parameter:

Concatenation with 'join'='outer':
     A   B key    C
0   A0  B0  K0  NaN
1   A1  B1  K1  NaN
0  NaN  B2  K1   C2
1  NaN  B3  K2   C3
Concatenation with 'join'='inner':
    B key
0  B0  K0
1  B1  K1
0  B2  K1
1  B3  K2

Join=outer takes the union of columns, and missing values are filled with NaN — not a number.

Join=inner takes the intersection of columns, keeping only the common columns.

So there you have it: Your ultimate guide to wielding the power of pandas.concat(). Build comprehensive data landscapes, unveil hidden patterns, and conquer data chaos confidently. The world of data analytics is your oyster.

What does the concat() function return in Pandas?
The return value of pandas.concat() in Python depends on several factors, including the input data, the chosen arguments, and the specific context of your operation. Depending on the combined objects and the chosen axis, the function generates a new Series or DataFrame as the output.
