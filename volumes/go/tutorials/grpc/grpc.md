# **[A basic tutorial introduction to gRPC in Go](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/basics/)**

This tutorial provides a basic Go programmer’s introduction to working with gRPC.

By walking through this example you’ll learn how to:

- Define a service in a .proto file.
- Generate server and client code using the protocol buffer compiler.
- Use the Go gRPC API to write a simple client and server for your service.

It assumes that you have read the **[Introduction to gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/)** and are familiar with protocol buffers. Note that the example in this tutorial uses the proto3 version of the protocol buffers language: you can find out more in the proto3 language guide and the Go generated code guide.
