## Basics tutorial

A basic tutorial introduction to gRPC in Go.

This tutorial provides a basic Go programmer’s introduction to working with gRPC.

By walking through this example you’ll learn how to:

- Define a service in a .proto file.
- Generate server and client code using the protocol buffer compiler.
- Use the Go gRPC API to write a simple client and server for your service.

It assumes that you have read the Introduction to gRPC and are familiar with protocol buffers. Note that the example in this tutorial uses the proto3 version of the protocol buffers language: you can find out more in the **[proto3 language guide](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3)** and the **[Go generated code guide](https://protobuf.dev/reference/go/go-generated)**.
