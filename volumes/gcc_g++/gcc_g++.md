## Using C++ on Linux in VS Code

In this tutorial, you will configure Visual Studio Code to use the GCC C++ compiler (g++) and GDB debugger on Linux. GCC stands for GNU Compiler Collection; GDB is the GNU debugger.

After configuring VS Code, you will compile and debug a simple C++ program in VS Code. This tutorial does not teach you GCC, GDB, Ubuntu or the C++ language. For those subjects, there are many good resources available on the Web.

If you have trouble, feel free to file an issue for this tutorial in the VS Code documentation repository.
