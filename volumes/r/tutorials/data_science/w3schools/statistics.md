Statistics is the science of analyzing, reviewing and conclude data.

Some basic statistical numbers include:

- Mean, median and mode
- Minimum and maximum value
- Percentiles
- Variance and Standard Devation
- Covariance and Correlation

You will learn about these features, and how to use them in the next chapters.
