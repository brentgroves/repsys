## Comparing next record to previous record

<https://www.scaler.com/topics/lag-function-in-sql/#:~:text=In%20SQL%20Server%20(Transact%2DSQL,making%20it%20easier%20to%20compare>.

In SQL Server (Transact-SQL), LAG() is a window function that allows us to compare the current record value with the value of previous records. This previous record value can be returned on the same record without the use of self-join, thus making it easier to compare.
