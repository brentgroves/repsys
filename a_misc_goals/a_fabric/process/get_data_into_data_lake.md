# Publish Power BI report

Ricardo,
This is my first time to publish a Power BI report in the Linamar Fabric workspace, so please bear with me. I will keep you posted as to my progress.

The following is in markdown format and can be viewed by copying and pasting the contents below into an online markdown viewer, such as at <https://markdownlivepreview.com/>.

## step 1

Get data into the E055 lakehouse:

1. Create an ETL pipeline to get the data from the **source** database to the E055 lakehouse.
2. Create an ETL pipeline to automate the uploading of the excel file and copying the data to the E055 Lakehouse.
3. Upload the excel file into lakehouse files folder and run report from there?
