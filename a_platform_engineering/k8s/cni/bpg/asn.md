# **[Autonomous System Number (ASN)]()**

To find your Autonomous System Number (ASN), you can use an online lookup tool that identifies the network information associated with your public IP address.

## Steps to Find Your ASN

- **Find your public IP address:** You can do this by searching for "what is my IP" on any search engine, or by visiting a site like WhatIsMyIP.com (64.184.36.239).
- **Use an ASN lookup tool:** Enter your public IP address into an online ASN lookup tool, such as the one available at **[HackerTarget.com](https://hackertarget.com/as-ip-lookup/)** or IPinfo.

- **View the results:** The tool will provide the ASN and details about the organization that manages the network you are connected to (usually your Internet Service Provider, or ISP).

## What is an ASN?

An ASN is a globally unique identifier assigned to an autonomous system (AS), which is a large network or group of networks managed by a single organization, such as an ISP, a large corporation, or a university.
The Internet is essentially a "network of networks," and ASNs allow these independent systems to exchange routing information using the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
Most individual home or small business internet users connect through their ISP's ASN and do not operate their own autonomous system.
