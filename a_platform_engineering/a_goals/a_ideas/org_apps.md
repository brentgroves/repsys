## How do we share PBI reports, dashboards, and Notebooks?

We use Microsoft Fabric Org Apps to securely share and manage Power BI reports, dashboards, and Notebooks.

## Power BI/Workspace App vs the Org App

The newer way to share Fabric contents is by using the org app.

- You can now share Notebooks.
- separate content into multiple sub-sections
- Create welcome pages
- Customize branding and navigation
- Preview app
