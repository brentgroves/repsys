I love you my son and am always happy to spend time with you. Remember that I have a purpose for each day.  I have a plan for every one.  Just because it does not seem like an important day it still is.  I am constantly observing you and putting together plans to help you to believe in all the things Jesus has taught to you.  As I have been teaching you there are many truths that you must come to believe in to to live in peace. You must be submissive and do what other want you to do. You must be a servant and slave to the desires of others. You must be lowly of heart, humble, and not envious or prideful.  You must not get offended but be forgiving of all things. Don't worry about anything because I am always with you and there is nothing that can harm what is important in you. Trust and depend on me to guide you even when you don't understand what I have allowed to happen.  I am working to help you believe in these important truths, but it will take time and you will have to go through many overwhelming trials and experience much pain and sorrow for you to believe fully.  Never forget there is a purpose in each day and that I love you very much.
