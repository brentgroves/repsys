# Viewing Options

The github viewer has timeout issues rendering mermaid diagrams. For "unable to render" error please press the "<-->" button above that mermaid diagram to view it. Experiment with theming to get the best view. I think high contrast dark themes work best!

Note: Press ctrl-shift-v to render markdown after installing the "Markdown Preview Mermaid Support" extension in Visual Studio Code or GitHub.Dev.

Mermaid is a JavaScript-based diagramming and charting tool that uses Markdown-inspired text definitions and a renderer to create and modify complex diagrams. The main purpose of Mermaid is to help documentation catch up with development.
