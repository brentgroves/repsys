# Delta Tables

Hi Team,

## SSL/TSL References

- **[Cipher suites](https://www.ssldragon.com/blog/cipher-suites/)** contain a key exchange, encryption, message authentication code, and pseudorandom function.
- **[Security Levels](https://www.feistyduck.com/library/openssl-cookbook/online/openssl-command-line/understanding-security-levels.html)** are used to catagorize each cypher suites.
- The reason to use **[TLS 1.3 instead of TLS 1.3](https://www.a10networks.com/glossary/key-differences-between-tls-1-2-and-tls-1-3/#:~:text=As%20with%20SSL%2C%20TLS%20relies,%E2%80%9D%20(0%2DRTT).)** is that it is faster, supports simpler and stronger cipher suites.
