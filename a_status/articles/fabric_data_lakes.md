# Microsoft Fabric, Data Lakes, and unstructured and semi-structured data

Hi Team,

The Structures Information Systems group is researching Microsoft Fabric.  Thank you, Tarek and Cody, for helping us get started. Here is some basic information that is probably old news to Tarek and Cody, but it could be useful to the rest of us.

The following is in markdown format and can be viewed by copying and pasting the contents below into an online markdown viewer, such as at <https://markdownlivepreview.com/>.

## **[What is Microsoft Fabric?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/fundamentals/microsoft-fabric-overview)**

Control software to manage structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data.  For unstructured and semi-structured data, it uses **[Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction)**. For structured data, we can use **[SQL databases](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/database/sql/overview)**.

## **[Data Lake](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-a-data-lake)**

A data lake is where we collect our unstructured and semi-structured data.

## **[Structured Data](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dbms/what-is-structured-data/)**

Any data that is kept in a relational database. We use SQL to analyze this data.

## **[Unstructured data](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-unstructured-data/)**

Unstructured data includes documents, web pages, emails, posts, sensor data, and images.

How to organize it:

- find patterns.
- Classify and group it.
- Label it with a tag.

## **[semi structured data](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-semi-structured-data/)**

It is a mix of structured and unstructured data. It contains metadata that helps to identify the content. Examples of semi-structured data include an XML document containing tags, log files, and IoT data. This data is clear, but is not yet in a form we could directly report.
