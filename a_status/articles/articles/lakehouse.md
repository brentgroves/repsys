# lakehouse

Structures new directive is to improve its decision-making capabilities by analyzing data in various formats across multiple sources using Microsoft Fabric.

The foundation of Microsoft Fabric is a lakehouse.

## 1. Load data into a lakehouse

Fabric lakehouses are a central element for our analytics solution. We can follow the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to ingest and transform data before loading to the lakehouse.

## Lakehouse access

Lakehouse access is managed through a workspace or item-level sharing.

## Linamar Fabric Workspace

Structure workspace uses the same directory structure as the Linamar Global workspace. It is managed by the Structures Information System group.

Fabric lakehouses also support data governance features including sensitivity labels, and can be extended by using Microsoft Purview with your Fabric tenant.
