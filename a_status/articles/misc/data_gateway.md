# Microsoft Fabric / High-availability Data Gateway

Hi Team,

The Structures Information Systems group is setting up and administering the Structures Microsoft Fabric workspace. This workspace will help us achieve the goal of centralizing our business data to give us previously impossible insights.  The next step in this process is to set up a data gateway.

This data gateway will enable the Microsoft Fabric Data Factory to access on-premise data and data sources available through ODBC connections, such as the Plex ERP. A high-availability gateway cluster can be set up on our Structures MicroCloud.  This gateway will help us achieve the goal of centralizing our business data in Linamar's Microsoft Fabric OneLake.

Thank you.
