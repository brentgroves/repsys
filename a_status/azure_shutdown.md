# cancel Mobex Azure Subsription

Hi Team,

We can do one of two things:

1. Instead of canceling the subscription, we can remove all of its resources to prevent unwanted charges.

2. We can cancel the Azure subscription if we no longer need it.

I can do this if I am assigned as an administrator of the Azure subscription with conditions.

thank you,

Although not required, Microsoft recommends that you take the following actions before you cancel your subscription:

- Back up your data. For example, if you're storing data in Azure storage or SQL, download a copy. If you have a virtual machine, save an image of it locally.
- Shut down your services. Go to the All resources page, and Stop any running virtual machines, applications, or other services.
- Consider migrating your data. See Move resources to new resource group or subscription.
- Delete all resources and all resource groups.
  - To later manually delete a subscription, you must first delete all resources associated with the subscription.
  - You might be unable to delete all resources, depending on your configuration. For example, if you have immutable blobs. For more information, see Immutable Blobs.
- If you have any custom roles that reference this subscription in AssignableScopes, you should update those custom roles to remove the subscription. If you try to update a custom role after you cancel a subscription, you might get an error. For more information, see Troubleshoot problems with custom roles and Azure custom roles.

## Progress

## Mobex Azure SQL MI to Linamar Azure SQL database migration

- Created a backup of Linamar's Azure SQL MI and imported it into an on-prem SQL Server database. Then, I created a backup of the OnPrem database and imported it into the Azure SQL database. Direct importing of a backup is not supported from Azure SQL MI to Azure SQL database. Done.
Connect to Plex using the OpenAccess data direct ODBC driver from the second system running a newer version of Ubuntu and OpenSSL, which does not support the preferred TLS 1.2 cipher suite that the DataDirect driver uses by default. Done.
