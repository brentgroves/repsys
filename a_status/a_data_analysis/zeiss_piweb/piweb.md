ZEISS PiWeb allows you to group data based on available quality data characteristics in no time. Quick analysis for quick decisions: For example, you can compare the quality between different suppliers or compare the quality between mold cavities.

The sorting function helps you to effortlessly prepare results exactly how you want them. The possibilities are limitless, but as an example, you can sort a single measuring result via tolerance to show characteristics that need the most attention first or sort multiple results by an attribute like lot number.

Interpreting mountains of data requires efficient filtering. With ZEISS PiWeb, users can apply multiple filters to answer ever-changing questions that arise in production, such as: What does the quality look like at machining center 1? How was the quality yesterday during the night shift? Easily answer these questions with ZEISS PiWeb!

Get informed automatically via email or a desktop client when parts or characteristics are trending out of tolerance. An integrated event handler actively compares incoming quality data against defined rules and automatically informs the responsible person.
