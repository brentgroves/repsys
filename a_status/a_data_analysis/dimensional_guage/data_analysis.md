# gage data analysis

Basically, what I need from you is a way to capture the data and and put it in a run chart.  
It would be great if the data and chart could show 30 day CPK and 90 day PPK.

**[cpk](https://www.1factory.com/quality-academy/guide-process-capability.html#:~:text=Cpk%20measures%20both%20the%20centering,Spec%20Width%20=%20USL%20%E2%80%94%20LSL)**

Cpk data analysis assesses a process's ability to meet specifications by measuring both its centering and variability. A higher Cpk value indicates a more capable process, while a Cpk below \(1.0\) suggests the process is not capable and likely to produce defects. Analysis involves plotting the data, calculating the Cpk using the formula: \(Cpk=min(USL-\text{mean})/(3*\text{Stdev}),(\text{mean}-LSL)/(3*\text{Stdev})\), and interpreting the results to identify areas for improvement.
