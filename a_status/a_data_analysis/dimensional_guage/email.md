# marposs guage

Hi April,
Thanks for the pics. Is it possible to borrow or take a look at the dimensional gauge. Have collected data from the serial port by programming a macro key of one of our older guages and wanted to see if the marposs guage is the same.

# notes

The Mach2 process for collecting data from the dimensional gauge should be similar to the scales which also use serial device servers.
