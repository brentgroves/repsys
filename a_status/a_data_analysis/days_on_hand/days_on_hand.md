## Definition

Inventory Days on Hand (DOH) measures how long it takes to sell or use current inventory, providing insights into inventory management efficiency.

## Used for the following

- Set raw material reorder points based on sales orders.
- Set tooling reorder points based on sales orders.
- Set finished goods totals based on sales orders.

## Daily Plex Snapshots

Use **[ETL](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/etl#:~:text=ETL%E2%80%94meaning%20extract%2C%20transform%2C,lake%20or%20other%20target%20system.)** scripts to collect a daily snapshot of Plex info into our data warehouse. This will help us with "Days on Hand" calculations.

- Sales orders.
- Daily raw and finished goods balances.
- Tooling balances.
