# Additional Azure Resources Needed

Hi team,
Corporate wants to delagate Fabric admin responsibility to business units. In addition to the Azure SQL database and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) we need a PowerBI pro license.

- thanks

## Publish visuals

- sam and brent g. are fabric admins but don't have a powerbi pro license.
- when a powerbi report is made it would be sent to an admin.
- the admin would import the report and share it to whoever needs access.

Hi Tarek. What Microsoft Licenses do we need as Fabric administrators?
Power BI Premium Per User (PPU) license or a Fabric license. <https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Fabric-platform/Fabric-Administrator-requires-also-Power-BI-or-Fabric-License/m-p/4680658#:~:text=%E2%9C%85%20Yes%2C%20a%20License%20Is,will%20also%20enable%20admin%20access>.

 Solved: Re: Fabric Administrator requires also Power BI or... - Microsoft Fabric Community

Hi yes your assumption is correct. Employee assiged as Admistrator role in fabric but he is unable to access the admin portal, So, he needs Fabric

Microsoft Fabric admin portal

- Acquire and work with capacities
- Ensure quality of service
- Manage workspaces
- Publish visuals
- Verify codes used to embed Microsoft Fabric in other applications
- Troubleshoot data access and other issues
