Hi Tarek. What Microsoft Licenses do we need as Fabric administrators?
Power BI Premium Per User (PPU) license or a Fabric license. <https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Fabric-platform/Fabric-Administrator-requires-also-Power-BI-or-Fabric-License/m-p/4680658#:~:text=%E2%9C%85%20Yes%2C%20a%20License%20Is,will%20also%20enable%20admin%20access>.

 Solved: Re: Fabric Administrator requires also Power BI or... - Microsoft Fabric Community

Hi yes your assumption is correct. Employee assiged as Admistrator role in fabric but he is unable to access the admin portal, So, he needs Fabric
