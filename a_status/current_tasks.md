# Current Tasks

- **[Use Linux Networking Features for Certificate Management verifications](../research/m_z/virtualization/networking/firewalls/iptables_nft/port_forwarding/research21_to_k8sgw2/research21_to_k8sgw2.md#start-here)**

  **[IPtable's nat table](../research/m_z/virtualization/networking/firewalls/iptables_nft/iptables_process_flow.md)** is used to implement network address translation rules. As packets enter the network stack, rules in this table will determine whether and how to modify the packetâ€™s source or destination addresses in order to impact the way that the packet and any response traffic are routed. This is often used to route packets to networks when direct access is not possible.
