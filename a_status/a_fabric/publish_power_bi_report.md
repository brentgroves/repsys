# Publish Power BI report

Hi team,
Structures Information Systems is working with Corporate to establish a way to publish and secure Power BI reports using Microsoft Fabric. If you would like a Power BI report to be made please contact myself or someone in Information Systems.

Ricardo,
This is my first time to publish a Power BI report in the Linamar Fabric workspace, so please bear with me. I will keep you posted as to my progress.

- Thank you,
