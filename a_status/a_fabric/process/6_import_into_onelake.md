# Publish Power BI report

Ricardo,
This is my first time to publish a Power BI report in the Linamar Fabric workspace, so please bear with me. I will keep you posted as to my progress.

The following is in markdown format and can be viewed by copying and pasting the contents below into an online markdown viewer, such as at <https://markdownlivepreview.com/>.

## Today

I see that you have formatted certain sheets in Power BI-OAM.xlsx that are used as the data source of your PBI report. Good. We can use this Power BI formatted excel to syncronize the lakehouse data using the **[onelake file explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/onelake-file-explorer)**, but we will do this later in the process.

Please send me a copy of your PBI report.

## Next

Transfer data into lakehouse.
