# Publish Power BI report

Ricardo,
This is my first time to publish a Power BI report in the Linamar Fabric workspace, so please bear with me. I will keep you posted as to my progress.

The following is in markdown format and can be viewed by copying and pasting the contents below into an online markdown viewer, such as at <https://markdownlivepreview.com/>.

## Today

Used Python OpenPyXL library to transform worksheet.

- replace formulas in columns D through G with values from referenced sheet.
- delete all sheets except those for PBI data source.

Please send me a copy of your PBI report.

## Next

Transfer data into lakehouse.
