# Publish Power BI report

Ricardo,
This is my first time to publish a Power BI report in the Linamar Fabric workspace, so please bear with me. I will keep you posted as to my progress.

The following is in markdown format and can be viewed by copying and pasting the contents below into an online markdown viewer, such as at <https://markdownlivepreview.com/>.

## step 1

Since the data contained in this Excel file is not in any database let's start by uploading it to our lakehouse file folder and creating a database schema for it.

## schema

One line has one or more machines.
One machine has one or more oils.
Each oils has a cost and the cost may change.
All date,line,machine,oils,costs should be reportable in any way desired.
