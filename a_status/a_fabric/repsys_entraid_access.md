Hi Team,

You all have EntraId access to the data warehouse. You can **[connect to it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/quickstart-sql-database)** with the **[Azure Data Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/quickstart-sql-database)**. When you create a connection choose "Microsoft EntraID universal with MFA support". The acount should populate for you "Brent Groves - <bGroves@linamar.com>". You can use the defaults on the other parameters. When you connect the browser should ask you to confirm your identity.

## Notes

Azure Data Studio officially retires on February 28, 2026. You should migrate to Visual Studio Code. This change aims to consolidate SQL development tools and provide a more robust and feature-rich environment for the developer community.

For now Azure Data Studio works fine.
