# Fabric

Hi Team,

As you may know Microsoft unified there data analytics and AI services with Fabric. Central to transforming and loading data into the Lakehouse is Apache Spark.

Why does Microsoft Fabric use Apache Spark to transform and load data?
Answer: For the same reason we use multiple cpu cores instead of only trying to increase a processors cpu speed.  A notebook running the Apache Spark engine uses 10 vCPU cores instead of 2 as you get when running a standard Python notebook. It completes ETL work much faster than traditional methods; especially when dealing with large datasets.

Next: How do we share PBI reports, dashboards, and Notebooks?
Power BI/Workspace App vs the Org App.
