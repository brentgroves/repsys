# Fabric

Hi Team,

With languages such as Power Query's M code and DAX we can use almost anything as a data source: database, excel, csv, web sites, etc.  If we have a one time report creating a report based on excel file(s) or even a table found in a website is perfect.  But if our report is needed on a regular basis we should move it to a data base, data lake, or data warehouse. This is easily done with Power Query or Notebooks. We can still use Excel to enter the data, but a Power Query or Notebook ETL script is used to transfer that data to a more reliable/scalable data source for PBI reporting.

Next: How do we share PBI reports, dashboards, and Notebooks?
Power BI/Workspace App vs the Org App.
