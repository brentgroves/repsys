# Fabric

Hi Team,

As you may know Microsoft unified there data analytics and AI services with Fabric. Central to transforming and loading data into the Lakehouse is Apache Spark.

How do we share PBI reports, dashboards, and Notebooks?
Power BI/Workspace App vs the Org App.

The newer way to share Fabric contents is by using the org app.

- You can now share Notebooks.
- separate content into multiple sub-sections
- Create welcome pages
- Customize branding and navigation
- Preview app

The following is in markdown format and can be viewed by copying and pasting the contents below into an online markdown viewer, such as at <https://markdownlivepreview.com/>.
