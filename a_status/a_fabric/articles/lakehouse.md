# Microsoft Fabric Notes

Hi Team,

As you may know Microsoft unified there data analytics and AI services with Fabric. Central to Microsoft Fabric is a Lakehouse.

What is a Fabric Lakehouse?
Answer: It is a Parquet file with a delta log.

Next: Why does Microsoft push Apache Spark for analytics instead of SSIS?

- thanks

- **[Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/)**

Apache Parquet is an open source, column-oriented data file format designed for efficient data storage and retrieval. It provides high performance compression and encoding schemes to handle complex data in bulk and is supported in many programming language and analytics tools.

- **[Delta log](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2019/08/21/diving-into-delta-lake-unpacking-the-transaction-log.html)**

When a user creates a table, that tableâ€™s transaction log is automatically created in the _delta_log subdirectory. As he or she makes changes to that table, those changes are recorded as ordered, atomic commits in the transaction log. Each commit is written out as a JSON file, starting with 000000.json. Additional changes to the table generate subsequent JSON files in ascending numerical order so that the next commit is written out as 000001.json, the following as 000002.json, and so on.
