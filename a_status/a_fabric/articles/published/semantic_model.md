Hi Team,

A cornerstone of PBI reporting is the semantic model. It is an abstraction layer between a report and it's raw data.  In it we link and transform data sources to calculate facts used in analysis. Like in modular programming once you have calculated a fact you don't want to redo that calculation. At the very least it is a waste of time and at the worst you or someone else might perform that calculation differently and come up with different results.

Next:  Excel as a data source.
Following That: How do we share PBI reports, dashboards, and Notebooks?
Power BI/Workspace App vs the Org App.
