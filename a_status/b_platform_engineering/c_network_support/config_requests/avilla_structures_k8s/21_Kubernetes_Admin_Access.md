Issue: The Avilla Structures Kubernetes administrator does not have access to all the MicroCloud/k8s host nodes from Albion.

Project: Avilla Structures Kubernetes Cluster

K8s IP range: 10.188.50.[200-212]

Request: Please give the Structures Kubernetes Cluster administrator SSH access to all the MicroCloud/K8s host nodes.

Reason: The Structures Kubernetes Cluster administrator would like to manage the cluster from Albion.

Affected Application: Automated ETL and Report System, Tool Management System, and Tool Tracker Focused **[Manufacturing Execution System](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/mes-system)**

Business Justification: The Avilla Structures Kubernetes Cluster will be used to run Structures Information System software such as the Automated ETL and Report System, Tool Management System, and Tool Tracker Focused **[Manufacturing Execution System](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/mes-system)**. These projects are for all of Linamar Structures but are currently directed toward Southfield, Albion, Avilla, and possibly Mills River.

## Requested Policy Change

Please expand the Kubernetes policy to give the Structures Kubernetes Cluster administrator SSH access to all the MicroCloud/K8s host nodes.

## Verify

From the Structures Kubernetes Administrator's PC running in Albion SSH into the Structures MicroCloud nodes which will host the Kubernetes Cluster.
