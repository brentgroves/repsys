Just started using Oracle's star review app in October and wasn't quite sure how to use it. For 2026 I decided to use **[Jira (AI-Powered Project Management)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPOWZSxEslU)** to manage the Oracle's Star review goals. If you would like to use Jira to help manage the goals you have set in the Oracle's Star review app here are the steps.

## What is Jira

- AI project management
- Proprietary but includes Open Source components.
- 10 person team free for all apps

## Workflow to manage goals in Oracle's Star Review app with Jira

1. Create goals using `Oracle's Star Review` app.
2. Duplicate the goals in `Oracle's Star Review` in a Jira project space called `2026 Star Review`.
3. Create a separate Jira project space for each goal in the `2026 Star Review` project space.
4. Add task items for each Jira project space.
5. Use the Jira `2026 Star Review` project space to decide what goal to work on each day.
6. Update the Jira project space task item(s) for this goal as needed.
7. Add supervisor to all your `Star Review` project spaces.
8. Review Jira project space goals and tasks with supervisor.
