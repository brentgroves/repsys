# fabric questions

Good morning Tarek,

I have a few Microsoft Fabric questions that I hope you can help me with.  

Thank you

- Is IFS accessed through a gateway on prem?
- Is your workspace connected Azure Data Lake Storage and does it have OneDrive access enabled?
- Is your PowerBI reports accessing a Fabric Warehouse or connecting to SQL servers?
- What license does a Power App programmer need to connect to a SQL database or Fabric Warehouse?
