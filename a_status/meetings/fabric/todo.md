# Microsoft Fabric OneLake, Azure SQL database mirroring, Structures Work Space, Storage, and Power BI

Hi Team,

The Structures group is working with the corporate analytics team to ensure that the business data we generate is sent to Linamar's Microsoft Fabric OneLake. With our data in one place, it will be possible to link it together to gain previously impossible insights. Below is a list of some of the data we are working to put in OneLake. Contact an Information Systems team member for additional details and other data sources that would benefit from Power BI dashboards and reports.

-Â Thank you

## Goal

Send all data that Structures generates to **[OneLake](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/onelake-overview#:~:text=OneLake%20is%20the%20OneDrive%20for,business%20users%20to%20use%20them.)**.

### Select Plex ERP data

From Azure Fabric we can connect to **[IFS](https://docs.ifs.com/techdocs/Foundation1/050_development/024_integration/010_restful_odata/)** through an **[OData](https://www.odata.org/)** RESTful API.  

**From Google AI:** Plex Manufacturing Cloud supports data integration through various methods, including the OData standard. Verify this.

### Raw PLC sensor, pressure, and scale data

### CNC tool operation start and end times

### Tooling vending machine usage data

### CMM reports and tool adjustments
