# **[Microsoft Fabric, workspaces](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/fundamentals/microsoft-fabric-overview)**

Hi Team,

For our "Microsoft Fabric meeting" I thought it would be helpful to review what a Microsoft Fabric workspace is. Finally, a meeting has been scheduled for this Friday at 2 PM. I hope you can attend.

- Thank you

## Microsoft Fabric, workspaces

In Microsoft Fabric, workspaces are collaborative containers that organize and manage various data and analytics assets. They serve as central hubs for teams to work together on projects, share content, and manage permissions. Think of them as virtual project spaces where users can build, manage, and analyze data solutions using tools like Power BI, dataflows, notebooks, and more.

Here's a more detailed look:

## Collaboration

Workspaces are designed for team collaboration, allowing multiple users to work on the same project and share content.

## Organization

They help organize different data and analytics assets like lakehouses, warehouses, reports, and pipelines, making it easier to manage and access relevant resources.

## Content Sharing

Workspaces allow for sharing content both at the workspace level and at the individual item level, enabling flexible sharing options.

## Integration

Workspaces integrate with other Microsoft Fabric components like OneLake for data storage and various data services for different analytical needs.
Two Types:
There are "My Workspace" for personal use and "regular workspaces" for collaboration.

## Capacity

Workspaces can be associated with a capacity (a dedicated resource pool) or use a shared capacity, which impacts storage and performance.

## Monitoring

Workspace monitoring allows administrators and users to track usage and performance of items within the workspace.
