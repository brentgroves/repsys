## Plan

The goal is to get Azure resource costs to be approximately $500 per month. Also to request a resource group named "repsys" in which the user "bGroves@linamar.com" is assigned the "Contributor" role.

- Create an Excel file showing the estimated monthly cost of all Azure resources.
- Contact IT and IS team to gather any resource needs I may be unaware of.
- Back up our Azure SQL work and data warehouse database schemas.
- Test recovering these schemas to an Azure SQL database in the mobex tenant in the "repsys" resource group.
- Conduct meetings as-needed with Brent H. Amir, Jarod, and Kevin.
- Create a bash script that uses the Azure CLI to create all Azure resources.

## sample script

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
pushd .
cd ~/src/repsys/research/azure_sql_server/linamar
source ./vars.sh
# https://linuxize.com/post/bash-printf-command/

printf "subscription=%s \
\nlocation=%s \
\nresourceGroup=%s \
\ntag=%s \
\nserver=%s \
\ndatabase=%s \
\nlogin=%s \
\npassword=%s \
\nstartIp=%s \
\nendIp=%s" \
$subscription $location $resourceGroup \
$tag $server $database $login \
$password $startIp $endIp
az account set -s $subscription # ...or use 'az login'
echo "Using resource group $resourceGroup with login: $login, password: $password..."
echo "Creating $resourceGroup in $location..."

# Add user to contributor role of resource
az role assignment create --assignee "bGroves@linamar.com" \
--role "Contributor" \
--scope "/subscriptions/f7d0cfcb-65b9-4f1c-8c9d-f8f993e4722a/resourceGroups/repsys"

# Verify role has been added
