# Markdown with Markmap and Mermaid Viewing Options

To get the full effect of Markmap mindmap menus and Mermaid diagrams I recommend using Visual Studio Code or **[Visual Studio Code On-Line](https://github.dev/brentgroves/repsys/blob/main/development/status/weekly/2024/week18.md)** with the following extensions:

- **[Visual Studio Code Mermaid extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid)**
- **[Visual Studio Code Markmap extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gera2ld.markmap-vscode)**

Note: Press ctrl-shift-v to render markdown after installing the "Markdown Preview Mermaid Support" extension in Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio Code On-Line.

You can also view this markdown directly from **[GitHub](https://github.com/brentgroves/repsys/blob/main/development/status/2024/week18.md)** but there are styling issues.

The github viewer has timeout issues rendering mermaid diagrams. For "unable to render" error please press the "<-->" button above that mermaid diagram to view it. Experiment with theming to get the best view. I think high contrast dark themes work best!

## **[Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/edit)** (Also supports copy from Github gists and saving to .svg .png)

Mermaid is a JavaScript-based diagramming and charting tool that uses Markdown-inspired text definitions and a renderer to create and modify complex diagrams. The main purpose of Mermaid is to help documentation catch up with development.
