## Financial – Investment of Choice

Migrate off the Mobex Azure tenant fully into the Linamar tenant to allow the Mobex Azure tenant to be shut down.

Status: Done.

Keep costs of the reporting system down by using low cost and open source software.

Status: Setup the following open source software to run the automated ETL reporting system.

- Ubuntu MicroCloud
- Ceph Cluster
- OVN Cluster
- LXD Cluster

## Employee – Employer of Choice

Publish the reporting system with the kubernetes cluster to a production use. This is an automated ETL system with a user interface to give users the ability to run reports such as the Trial Balance or MTBF & MTTR.

Status: Changed focus to creating and publishing the Structures Microsoft Fabric Medallion Workflow process. The ETL system along with the Structures Microsoft data gateway will now help with the process of transferring on-prem and previously impossible to access data sources to the Structures Power BI enabled Microsoft Fabric workspace data lakes.

## Personal - Personal and/or Team Growth

Begin to use modern tooling and systems to gain insights on various business unit data including big data, unstructured sensor data from machinery. Tools and systems such as academic data science fundamentals, Microsoft Fabric, and kubernetes.

Status:

- Cordinating an effort to capture data from the JT Front dimensional gages and create a run chart, histogram, 30 day CPK, and 90 day PPK. Previously, this was in the domain of Minitab and involved manually transferring data, but with the help of a serial device server, Mach2, Microsoft Fabric Notebooks, and Power BI we can automate this task and securely manage and publish dashboards and Notebooks containing process control statistical data that is easily viewable from the Structures Microsoft Fabric workspace in departmental org apps.

Produce 30 day CPK and 90 day PPK.

- **Cp** measures whether the process spread is narrower than the specification width

- **Cpk** measures both the centering of the process as well as the spread of the process relative to the specification width

- The Process Performance Index is known as **PpK**. It is a statistical metric that assesses how closely a process is operating within its long-term specification bounds.

## Customer – Supplier of Choice

Enabling the Linamar Structures to utilize the corporate data lake, using Microsoft Fabric, to include all of data in various databases - vending machines, CMM, PLC sensor, and other reporting data. This will make more complicated reports easier to create and maintain within the Structures group.

Status: In the process of creating the `Structures Microsoft Fabric Medallion Workflow` process. We are using the `Maintenance oil consumption` report as a test case to understand and document this new data analytics process. When complete Structures business data will be located in a centralized data lake enabling previously impossible insights. This process will enable us to securely manage Power BI, dashboards, and Notebooks. It will also encompass automated data collection for the management, creation, and visibility of statistical process control graphs and charts previously in the domain of Minitab.
