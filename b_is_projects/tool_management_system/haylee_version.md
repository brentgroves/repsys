# Tool Management System Team

Hayley, please tell us about the tool management software your team has developed. Albion is transitioning to a new vending machine and currently has older tool lists in a legacy database and newer tool lists in Excel. The Structures Information Systems team has scheduled to update a legacy tool system but this will not be completed for some time. So we are looking for something in the meantime to help with the vending machine transition.

Players:

- Pat Baxter, General Manager
- Christian. Trujillo, IT Structures Manager
- Kevin Young, Information Systems Manager
- Jared Davis, IT Manager
- Michael Percell, Manufacturing Engineering Manager
- Dan Martin, Plant Controller Southfield
- Jami Pyle, MP&L Manager
- Nancy Swank, Material Planner
- Hayley Rymer, IT Supervisor

## Legacy Tool Management System Scope

- CNC engineers use it to manage job tooling.
- Engineering managers use it to approve job tooling.
- MRO personnel are notified by it of new tooling to stock.
- It is integrated with our ERP, Vending Machines, and reporting system.
- Since it is integrated with our ERP we are able to plan which tooling to purchase based on upcoming job orders.
- Is also linked to a tool tracking system that reports tool life based on CNC, part, and tool numbers for problematic tooling.
