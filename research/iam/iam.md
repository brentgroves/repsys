## What is identity and access management? Guide to IAM

By
Sandra GittlenLinda Rosencrance
Identity and access management (IAM) is a framework of business processes, policies and technologies that facilitates the management of electronic or digital identities. With an IAM framework in place, information technology (IT) managers can control user access to critical information within their organizations. Systems used for IAM include single sign-on systems, two-factor authentication, multifactor authentication and privileged access management. These technologies also provide the ability to securely store identity and profile data as well as data governance functions to ensure that only data that is necessary and relevant is shared.

IAM systems can be deployed on premises, provided by a third-party vendor through a cloud-based subscription model or deployed in a hybrid model.

On a fundamental level, IAM encompasses the following components:

- how individuals are identified in a system (understand the difference between identity management and authentication);
- how roles are identified in a system and how they are assigned to individuals;
adding, removing and updating individuals and their roles in a system;
- assigning levels of access to individuals or groups of individuals; and
- protecting the sensitive data within the system and securing the system itself.

## Basic components of IAM

An IAM framework enables IT to control user access to critical information within their organizations. IAM products offer role-based access control, which lets system administrators regulate access to systems or networks based on the roles of individual users within the enterprise.

In this context, access is the ability of an individual user to perform a specific task, such as view, create or modify a file. Roles are defined according to job, authority and responsibility within the enterprise.

IAM systems should do the following: capture and record user login information, manage the enterprise database of user identities, and orchestrate the assignment and removal of access privileges.

That means systems used for IAM should provide a centralized directory service with oversight and visibility into all aspects of the company user base.

Digital identities are not just for humans; IAM can manage the digital identities of devices and applications to help establish trust.

In the cloud, IAM can be handled by authentication as a service or identity as a service (IDaaS). In both cases, a third-party service provider takes on the burden of authenticating and registering users, as well as managing their information. Read more about these cloud-based IAM options.

## Implementing IAM in the enterprise

Before any IAM system is rolled out into the enterprise, businesses need to identify who within the organization will play a lead role in developing, enacting and enforcing identity and access policies. IAM impacts every department and every type of user (employee, contractor, partner, supplier, customer, etc.), so it's essential the IAM team comprises a mix of corporate functions.

IT professionals implementing an IAM system largely on-premises and largely for employees should become familiar with the OSA IAM design pattern for identity management, SP-010. The pattern lays out the architecture of how various roles interact with IAM components as well as the systems that rely on IAM. Policy enforcement and policy decisions are separated from one another, as they are dealt with by different elements within the IAM framework.

## IAM vendors and products

IAM vendors range from large companies -- such as IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and RSA -- to pure-play providers -- such as Okta, Ping and SailPoint. Selecting the best IAM product or service for your organization requires legwork to determine the features that address your needs, such as centralized management, single sign-on, governance, compliance and risk analytics. Check out our 2020 IAM vendor, product and feature listing.
