# About Mermaid

Mermaid lets you create diagrams and visualizations using text and code.

It is a JavaScript based diagramming and charting tool that renders Markdown-inspired text definitions to create and modify diagrams dynamically.

If you are familiar with Markdown you should have no problem learning Mermaid's Syntax.
