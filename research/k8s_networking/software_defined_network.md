## What is Software-Defined Networking (SDN)?

Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an approach to networking that uses software-based controllers or application programming interfaces (APIs) to communicate with underlying hardware infrastructure and direct traffic on a network.

This model differs from that of traditional networks, which use dedicated hardware devices (i.e., routers and switches) to control network traffic. SDN can create and control a virtual network – or control a traditional hardware – via software.

While network virtualization allows organizations to segment different virtual networks within a single physical network, or to connect devices on different physical networks to create a single virtual network, software-defined networking enables a new way of controlling the routing of data packets through a centralized server.
