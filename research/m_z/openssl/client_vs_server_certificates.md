## What’s the difference between client certificates vs. server certificates?

**[Client certificates](https://www.digicert.com/tls-ssl/client-certificates)** are digital certificates for users and individuals to prove their identity to a server. Client certificates tend to be used within private organizations to authenticate requests to remote servers. Whereas server certificates are more commonly known as **[TLS/SSL certificates](https://www.digicert.com/tls-ssl/tls-ssl-certificates)** and are used to protect servers and web domains. Server certificates perform a very similar role to Client certificates, except the latter is used to identify the client/individual and the former authenticates the owner of the site.

## What is a client certificate?

Client certificates are, as the name indicates, used to identify a client or a user, authenticating the client to the server and establishing precisely who they are. To some, the mention of PKI or ‘Client certificates’ may conjure up images of businesses protecting and completing their customers’ online transactions, yet such certificates are found throughout our daily lives, in any number of flavors; when we sign into a VPN, use a bank card at an ATM, or a card to gain access to a building or within public transport smart cards. These digital certificates are even found in petrol pumps, the robots on car assembly lines and even in our passports.

In Continental Europe and in many other countries, the use of client certificates is particularly widespread, with governments issuing ID cards that have multiple uses, such as to pay local taxes, electricity bills and for drivers’ licenses. And the reason why is simple—client certificates play a vital role in ensuring people are safe online.
