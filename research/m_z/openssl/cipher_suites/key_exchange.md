The key exchange algorithm, such as **[RSA or Diffie-Hellman](https://www.ssldragon.com/blog/rsa-aes-encryption/)**, allows the client and server to exchange encryption keys safely. This secret key is then used in **[bulk encryption](https://www.ssldragon.com/blog/encryption-types-algorithms/)** algorithms, like AES or 3DES that employ symmetric keys to encrypt data in transit.
