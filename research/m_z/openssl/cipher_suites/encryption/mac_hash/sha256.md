Among the many advancements seen in network security, encryption and hashing have been the core principles of additional security modules. The secure hash algorithm with a digest size of 256 bits, or the SHA 256 algorithm, is one of the most widely used hash algorithms. While there are other variants, SHA 256 has been at the forefront of real-world applications.

## What is the SHA-256 Algorithm?

SHA 256 is a part of the SHA 2 family of algorithms, where SHA stands for Secure Hash Algorithm. Published in 2001, it was a joint effort between the NSA and NIST to introduce a successor to the SHA 1 family, which was slowly losing strength against brute force attacks.

The significance of the 256 in the name stands for the final hash digest value, i.e. irrespective of the size of plaintext/cleartext, the hash value will always be 256 bits.

The other algorithms in the SHA family are more or less similar to SHA 256. Now, look into knowing a little more about their guidelines.

## What are the Characteristics of the SHA-256 Algorithm?

Some of the standout features of the SHA algorithm are as follows:

- Message Length: The length of the cleartext should be less than 264 bits. The size needs to be in the comparison area to keep the digest as random as possible.
- Digest Length: The length of the hash digest should be 256 bits in SHA 256 algorithm, 512 bits in SHA-512, and so on. Bigger digests usually suggest significantly more calculations at the cost of speed and space.
- Irreversible: By design, all hash functions such as the SHA 256 are irreversible. You should neither get a plaintext when you have the digest beforehand nor should the digest provide its original value when you pass it through the hash function again.

## Steps in SHA-256 Algorithm

You can divide the complete process into five different segments, as mentioned below:

## Padding Bits

It adds some extra bits to the message, such that the length is exactly 64 bits short of a multiple of 512. During the addition, the first bit should be one, and the rest of it should be filled with zeroes.
