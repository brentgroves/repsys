Encryption is at the heart of data security, safeguarding sensitive information from unauthorized access. Among the vast array of encryption methods, RSA and AES stand out as two of the most widely used algorithms. However, they operate differently, serving distinct purposes in the world of cybersecurity.

In this guide, we’ll explore the key differences between RSA and AES encryption, helping you understand when each is best applied and why.

## What is RSA Encryption?

RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a widely recognized encryption algorithm developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman. It is an example of asymmetric encryption, meaning it uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The unique two-key system makes RSA highly secure for online data transmission, particularly in situations where safe communication is essential.

The core of RSA encryption lies in the mathematical difficulty of factoring large prime numbers, which makes it nearly impossible for hackers to deduce the private key based on the public key. RSA encryption is often used for secure data exchange over the internet, digital signatures, and SSL certificates, making it a key component of secure web browsing and communication.

What is AES Encryption?
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), established in 2001 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is a symmetric encryption algorithm that uses a single shared key for both encryption and decryption. Unlike RSA, AES is designed for speed and efficiency, making it ideal for encrypting large volumes of data in minimal time. This is particularly useful for encrypting data stored on devices or within secure networks, ensuring information remains inaccessible without the correct key.

AES encryption operates on a fixed block size of 128 bits and offers different key lengths—128, 192, and 256 bits—providing flexible security levels. Known for its simplicity and speed, AES is commonly applied in situations requiring high-speed encryption, such as securing wireless networks, encrypting files, and protecting VPN traffic.
