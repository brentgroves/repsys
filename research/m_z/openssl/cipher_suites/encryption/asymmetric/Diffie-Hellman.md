# **[Implementation of Diffie-Hellman Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementation-diffie-hellman-algorithm/)**

The Diffie-Hellman algorithm is being used to establish a shared secret that can be used for secret communications while exchanging data over a public network using the elliptic curve to generate points and get the secret key using the parameters.  

- For the sake of simplicity and practical implementation of the algorithm, we will consider only 4 variables, one prime P and G (a primitive root of P) and two private values a and b.
- P and G are both publicly available numbers. Users (say Alice and Bob) pick private values a and b and they generate a key and exchange it publicly. The opposite person receives the key and that generates a secret key, after which they have the same secret key to encrypt.

Step-by-Step explanation is as follows:  

| Alice                                    | Bob                                      |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Public Keys available = P, G             | Public Keys available = P, G             |
| Private Key Selected = a                 | Private Key Selected = b                 |
| Key generated =  x = G a m o d Px=GamodP | Key generated =  y = G b m o d Py=GbmodP |

Exchange of generated keys takes place

| Key received = y                                     | key received = x                                     |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Generated Secret Key =  k a = y a m o d Pka  =yamodP | Generated Secret Key =  k b = x b m o d Pkb  =xbmodP |

Algebraically, it can be shown that ka = kb

Users now have a symmetric secret key to encryptâ€‹

## Example

```bash
Step 1: Alice and Bob get public numbers P = 23, G = 9
Step 2: Alice selected a private key a = 4 and
        Bob selected a private key b = 3
Step 3: Alice and Bob compute public values
Alice:    x =(9^4 mod 23) = (6561 mod 23) = 6
        Bob:    y = (9^3 mod 23) = (729 mod 23)  = 16
Step 4: Alice and Bob exchange public numbers
Step 5: Alice receives public key y =16 and
        Bob receives public key x = 6
Step 6: Alice and Bob compute symmetric keys
        Alice:  ka = y^a mod p = 65536 mod 23 = 9
        Bob:    kb = x^b mod p = 216 mod 23 = 9
Step 7: 9 is the shared secret.

#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>

    else
        return (((long long int)pow(a, b)) % P);

    long long int P, G, x, a, y, b, ka, kb;

    // Alice will choose the private key a
    a = 4; // a is the chosen private key

    x = power(G, a, P); // gets the generated key

    // Bob will choose the private key b

    kb = power(x, b, P); // Secret key for Bob
    cout << "Secret key for the Alice is : " << ka << endl;

    cout << "Secret key for the Bob is : " << kb << endl;

    return 0;
