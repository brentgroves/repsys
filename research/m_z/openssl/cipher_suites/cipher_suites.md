A cipher suite is a set of cryptographic algorithms used to secure network communications in SSL/TLS protocols. It specifies how encryption, authentication, and data integrity are achieved by combining algorithms for key exchange, encryption, and message authentication. Cipher suites ensure secure data transmission over the internet.
