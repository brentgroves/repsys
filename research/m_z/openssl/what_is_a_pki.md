# **[What Is OpenSSL? How Does OpenSSL Work?](https://www.ssldragon.com/blog/what-is-openssl/)**

Proper SSL implementation is crucial to a website’s security and success. And, with so many web owners learning about SSL for the first time, it’s essential to equip them with all the necessary tools and utilities. One such tool is OpenSSL. So, what is OpenSSL, and why is it so important?

The following guide covers every aspect of this useful utility, including how to use OpenSSL and the various OpenSSL commands for easy and efficient SSL management.

OpenSSL is an open-source software library and command-line tool used to implement SSL and TLS protocols for secure communications. It provides cryptographic functions, such as generating keys and certificates, encrypting data, and verifying certificates, making it essential for internet security and server management.

## What Is OpenSSL Used For?

OpenSSL is an open-source command-line tool used to generate CSRs and private keys, install SSL files, merge and convert certificates into different SSL formats, verify certificate details, and troubleshoot issues. It plays a vital role in managing and securing SSL/TLS implementations.

To install an SSL certificate on your website, you must follow a few mandatory steps, which are the same for any server or email client. OpenSSL is especially handy when you don’t have a web control panel or want to streamline the whole process.

Since not all servers provide web user interfaces for SSL management, on some platforms OpenSSL is the only solution to import and configure your certificate.
