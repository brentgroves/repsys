Public key infrastructure (PKI) governs the issuance of digital certificates to protect sensitive data, provide unique digital identities for users, devices and applications and secure end-to-end communications.

## What is PKI?

Today, organizations rely on PKI to manage security through encryption. Specifically, the most common form of encryption used today involves a public key, which anyone can use to encrypt a message, and a private key (also known as a secret key), which only one person should be able to use to decrypt those messages. These keys can be used by people, devices, and applications.

PKI security first emerged in the 1990s to help govern encryption keys through the issuance and management of digital certificates. These PKI certificates verify the owner of a private key and the authenticity of that relationship going forward to help maintain security. The certificates are akin to a driver’s license or passport for the digital world.

Common examples of PKI security today are SSL certificates on websites so that site visitors know they’re sending information to the intended recipient, digital signatures, and authentication for Internet of Things devices.
