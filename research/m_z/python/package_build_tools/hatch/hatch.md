## Get to Know Hatch
Our Python packaging tutorials use the tool Hatch. While there are many great packaging tools out there, we have selected Hatch because:

It is an end-to-end tool that supports most of the steps required to create a quality Python package. Beginners will have fewer tools to learn if they use Hatch.

It supports different build back-ends if you ever need to compile code in other languages.

As a community, pyOpenSci has decided that Hatch is a user-friendly tool that supports many different scientific Python use cases.

In this tutorial, you will install and get to know Hatch a bit more before starting to use it.

You need two things to successfully complete this tutorial:

You need Python installed.

You need Hatch installed.
