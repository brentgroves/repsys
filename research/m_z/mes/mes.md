MES software monitors, tracks, documents, and controls the process of manufacturing goods from raw materials to finished products.

## So here comes MES

While SCADA is designed to control the production in real-time and ERP is designed for management of the company’s business processes, MES is designed to track and collect information about each product (semi-product) through all stages of the production process. It is a software capable of operating with big data received in real-time (PLC, SCADA), while also exchanging information with the transactional world (ERP, SCM, CRM).

MES’s purpose is to analyze and extract important information from this big data and forward it to ERP. Also, this software solution can convert work orders received from ERP to a production schedule and is capable of dispatching this schedule to the shop floor (PLC, SCADA). It is very important to properly correlate between process data and product quality and to provide and collect information in different formats from various systems.
