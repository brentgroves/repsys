In the context of 5G, GTP-U tunnels are used in the User Plane Function (UPF) to connect 5G mobile subscribers with the internet. If we were to create our own implementation of a UPF, using Open vSwitch to manage those tunnels is a viable option. In this tutorial, we will go through the process of creating a GTP-U tunnel on Ubuntu 22.04 using Open vSwitch (OVS).
