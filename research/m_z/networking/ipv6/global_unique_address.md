## Global Unicast Address

Global unicast addresses (GUAs) are globally routable and reachable in the IPv6 Internet; they are equivalent to public IPv4 addresses. GUA addresses are also known as aggregatable global unicast addresses, as mentioned in Chapter 4, “IPv6 Address Representation and Address Types.” The GUA address is one of several types of IPv6 unicast addresses shown in Figure 5-1.
