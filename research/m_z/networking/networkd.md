systemd-networkd.service, systemd-networkd â€” Network manager

## Synopsis

systemd-networkd.service

/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-networkd

## Description

systemd-networkd is a system service that manages networks. It detects and configures network devices as they appear, as well as creating virtual network devices.

To configure low-level link settings independently of networks, see systemd.link(5).

systemd-networkd will create network devices based on the configuration in systemd.netdev(5) files, respecting the [Match] sections in those files.

systemd-networkd will manage network addresses and routes for any link for which it finds a .network file with an appropriate [Match] section, see systemd.network(5). For those links, it will flush existing network addresses and routes when bringing up the device. Any links not matched by one of the .network files will be ignored. It is also possible to explicitly tell systemd-networkd to ignore a link by using Unmanaged=yes option, see systemd.network(5).

When systemd-networkd exits, it generally leaves existing network devices and configuration intact. This makes it possible to transition from the initrd and to restart the service without breaking connectivity. This also means that when configuration is updated and systemd-networkd is restarted, netdev interfaces for which configuration was removed will not be dropped, and may need to be cleaned up manually.

systemd-networkd may be introspected and controlled at runtime using networkctl(1).

## Configuration Files

The configuration files are read from the files located in the system network directory /usr/lib/systemd/network, the volatile runtime network directory /run/systemd/network and the local administration network directory /etc/systemd/network.

Networks are configured in .network files, see systemd.network(5), and virtual network devices are configured in .netdev files, see systemd.netdev(5).

## **[How to tell if networkd is running](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/640658/determine-current-networking-manager-being-used-on-linux#:~:text=Ubuntu%20(%20and%20Debian%20)%20uses%20NetworkManager,running%20and%20managing%20any%20interfaces.)**

Ubuntu ( and Debian ) uses NetworkManager by default but also has ifupdown installed by default if you want to configure /etc/network/interfaces. Running networkctl will tell you whether systemd-networkd is running and managing any interfaces
