## Site-to-Site VPN Settings

Meraki Auto VPN technology is a unique solution that allows site-to-site VPN tunnel creation with a single mouse click. When enabled through the dashboard, each participating MX and Z Series appliances automatically does the following:

Advertises its local subnets that are participating in the VPN.
Advertises its WAN IP addresses on Internet 1 and Internet 2 ports.
Downloads the global VPN route table from the dashboard (automatically generated by the dashboard, based on each MX's advertised WAN IP/local subnet in the VPN network).
Downloads the preshared key for establishing the VPN tunnel and traffic encryption.
The net result is an automatic mesh site-to-site VPN solution that is configured with a single click.
