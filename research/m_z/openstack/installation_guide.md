## Get started with OpenStack

The OpenStack project is an open source cloud computing platform for all types of clouds, which aims to be simple to implement, massively scalable, and feature rich. Developers and cloud computing technologists from around the world create the OpenStack project.

OpenStack provides an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) solution through a set of interrelated services. Each service offers an Application Programming Interface (API) that facilitates this integration. Depending on your needs, you can install some or all services.

## The OpenStack services¶

The OpenStack project navigator lets you browse the OpenStack services that make up the OpenStack architecture. The services are categorized per the service type and release series.
