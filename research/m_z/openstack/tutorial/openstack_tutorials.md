Before you get started!
Welcome to OpenStack!

In this series of tutorials, we will walk you through all the necessary steps to install, configure and get started with OpenStack. Using just your workstation, you will learn how to use OpenStack for cloud infrastructure implementation purposes, from a single-node installation to large-scale clusters.

This tutorial is the first in the “Phase I - Single-node OpenStack on your workstation” series.

## What is OpenStack?

OpenStack is a collection of open-source projects designed to work together to form the basis of a cloud. OpenStack can be used for both private and public cloud implementation.

## What is **[Sunbeam](https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/projects/sunbeam.html)**?

Sunbeam is an OpenStack project created to set the foundation for zero-ops OpenStack. By using highly opinionated architecture and native Kubernetes principles, Sunbeam delivers distilled OpenStack excellence on top of K8s.

## What is **[MicroStack](https://microstack.run/)**?

MicroStack (based on Sunbeam) is an OpenStack flavour designed for small-scale cloud environments, edge deployments, testing and development, with full commercial support available from Canonical.

## In this tutorial, you will learn how to

Install OpenStack on your workstation
Launch your first instance on OpenStack

## You will only need
