## How is it like Linux and K8s?

It is like Linux and K8s:

- Linux and K8s have one repository that all can look at and work on, and so does OpenStack.
- Linux and K8s both have a large healthy community driving them, and so does OpenStack.
- Linux and K8s both have large businesses invested in them, and so does OpenStack.  OpenStack has also been adopted by many government agencies in the US and abroad.
- Linux and K8s both have intrigued many groups to create their own distrobutions using the exact upstream source code, so has K8s.
