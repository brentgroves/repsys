## unit-file

Since the question mentions Arch Linux (systemd-controlled from day one) and logging, I'll hazard a guess it is related to logging from a systemd service. Here's another logging technique for shell scripts invoked from systemd service units. systemd can be (and by default is) set up to listen to the service's processes stderr and/or stdout, and forward messages to the journal. When a message starts with a 3-character prefix '<' N '>', where N is a digit from 0 to 7, systemd interprets it as the log level, omits it, and logs the rest of the string at the specified level.

It is convenient, since any stderr message from any command will be automatically logged at the error level. Another fd is reserved for logging at an arbitrary different severity.

This is of course available to all programs, not only shell scripts.

## systemd-cat

`systemd-cat` is the equivalent to logger:

`echo 'hello' | systemd-cat`

In another terminal, running `journalctl -f`:

Feb 07 13:38:33 localhost.localdomain cat[15162]: hello
Priorities are specified just by part of the string:

```bash
echo 'hello' | systemd-cat -p info
echo 'hello' | systemd-cat -p warning
echo 'hello' | systemd-cat -p emerg
```

Warnings are bold, emergencies are bold and red. Scary stuff.

You can also use an 'identifier' which is arbitrary, to specify the app name. These are like syslog's old facilities, but you're not stuck with ancient things like lpr uucp nntp or the ever-descriptive local0 through local7.

```bash
echo 'hello' | systemd-cat -t someapp -p emerg
echo 'hello' | systemd-cat -t myiptables -p emerg

echo 'hello' | systemd-cat -u myiptables -p emerg

journalctl -t someapp

```

Is logged as:

Feb 07 13:48:56 localhost.localdomain someapp[15278]: hello

Very useful. You can filter to the log messages created with -t using the following command: journalctl -t someapp â€“
