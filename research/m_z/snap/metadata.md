# **[snap metadata](https://snapcraft.io/docs/the-snap-format#heading--snapyaml)**

snap.yaml
Every snap package contains a meta/snap.yaml file that holds the basic metadata for the snap.

Please take note of this important distinction:

- snap.yaml lives inside every snap package, read by snapd
- snapcraft.yaml contains instructions to create a snap package, read by the snapcraft command used to build snaps

```bash
ls /snap/lxd/current/meta/snap.yaml
```

Most of the metadata supported by snap.yaml is optional. In fact, the simplest snap.yaml could contain as little as the following:

name: simplest
version: 1.0
An example snap.yaml that offers an application to run is still very simple:

name: simple
version: 1.0
apps:
    hello:
        command: bin/hello --world

```yaml
The following is the complete specification for the metadata in snap.yaml:

# The suggested snap name, constrained to the [a-z0-9] charset and inner
# dashes. The final name when the snap is installed is defined by the
# snap-declaration assertion associated with the snap, if any.
name: <name>

# An optional title for the snap, may contain uppercase letters and spaces.
title: <title>

# Version of the software packed inside the snap. Has no semantic value
# in the system (no greater/lower-than rules are ever applied to it).
version: <version>

# More details about what is contained in the snap.

## Hooks

Hooks provide a mechanism for snapd to alert snaps that something has happened, or to ask the snap to provide its opinion about an operation that is in progress. See the topic on **[supported hooks](https://snapcraft.io/docs/supported-snap-hooks)** for more details.

## Interfaces

Interfaces allow snaps to communicate or share resources according to the protocol established by the interface. They play an important part in security policy configuration.

See **[Supported interfaces](https://snapcraft.io/docs/supported-interfaces)** for more details.
