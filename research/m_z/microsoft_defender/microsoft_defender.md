(Lol) I realize it's not the MS-Edge browser; But, a lot of people use that other company's browser, Chrome.!? If you get locked-up with that fake MS-Defender phone number, and you're in the Chrome-browser; here's what you do..

You hit Cntrl-T which will generate a new "tab" and put you in the new tab. You then "carefully" arrow over to the left, to the tab where the scam has things locked; and you hit the little "x" to close the tab.

(lol) After hitting the Control-T you could go to the vertical 3-dots and just "Exit" the Chrome-browser; BUT but, if you've got your Startup Settings set to reopen the tabs where you "left off"; Then you'll just bring the scammed locked tab right back..??

(lol) I'm sure the MS-Edge browser has a very similar set up or scenario..? The key is to know or remember the keystroke-combination that takes you to a new tab.

Anyhow FWIW
