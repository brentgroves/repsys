Data joins and shuffles are two related concepts in big data processing. Joins combine datasets based on a common key, while shuffling is the expensive process of redistributing data across partitions, which is often required to perform a join operation, especially a shuffle join. Shuffle joins, in turn, partition and redistribute both datasets by the join key so that rows with the same key end up on the same executor for the join to be performed locally.

## Data shuffling

- **What it is:** A process of redistributing data across partitions in a distributed system.
- **Why it happens:** It is triggered by "wide transformations" like joins, group by, or window functions that require data from different partitions to be combined.
- **The cost:** It is a performance-intensive operation because it involves network I/O between nodes in a cluster, leading to high disk I/O and increased execution time.

## Relationship between joins and shuffles

A shuffle join is a type of join that is performed by first shuffling both datasets.
Shuffling is a necessary precursor to performing the join on the re-partitioned data.
Optimizing joins often means optimizing the shuffle process, for example, by strategically choosing join types (like broadcast hash join over shuffle hash join for small tables) or partitioning the data before joining to reduce the amount of data that needs to be shuffled.
