# **[What is M Code?](https://blog.dataddo.com/guide-to-m-code-in-power-bi-a-power-query-formula-language)**

M code is a **[mashup language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/m-spec-introduction)** designed to create queries that combine data. It is similar to the F# programming language and is described by Microsoft as a "mostly pure, higher-order, dynamically typed, partially lazy, functional language." M is also case-sensitive, so, for example, words like Source and source are considered different.
