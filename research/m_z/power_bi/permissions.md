## question

Hello Brent, Tarek,

I need help with Power BI, I generated a Report and I tried to shared with the team, but by the time they want to open it says either they need the license or they need access, nevertheless I already gave access to everybody. Would you please help me?

## answer

Hi Ricardo,

It sounds like you are trying to share the Power BI report from your personal workspace, which requires everyone to have a Power BI Pro license to access it. To avoid this issue, you need to publish the report to a premium capacity workspace, specifically the LS - Linamar Structures workspace. Please work with Brent, Sam, or Cody to publish your report to the LS - Linamar Structures workspace.

Thanks for reaching out and let me know if you need any further assistance!

Regards

Tarek Mohamed
