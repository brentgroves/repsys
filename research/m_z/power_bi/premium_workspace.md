premium capacity workspace, specifically the LS - Linamar Structures workspace

Hi Ricardo,

It sounds like you are trying to share the Power BI report from your personal workspace, which requires everyone to have a Power BI Pro license to access it. To avoid this issue, you need to publish the report to a premium capacity workspace, specifically the LS - Linamar Structures workspace. Please work with Brent, Sam, or Cody to publish your report to the LS - Linamar Structures workspace.

Thanks for reaching out and let me know if you need any further assistance!

## Premium capacity workspace

### LS - Linamar Structures workspace

A Premium capacity workspace in Power BI is a dedicated server space, purchased by an organization, that allows for enhanced functionality and broader content sharing compared to standard workspaces. It enables users to access reports and dashboards without needing a Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license, provided they have the necessary permissions. Premium capacities offer increased refresh rates, larger datasets, and the ability to share content with users who don't have a Pro license.
