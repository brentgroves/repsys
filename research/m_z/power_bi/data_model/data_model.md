Fact Table

- Lowest level of granularity
- What does 1 row represent
Sales at the transaction level.
We have millions of dollars worth of sales but what product.
but we don't have product information because are grain statement was just at the transaction.
if we want the information we have to make sure the row represents the product of a transaction.
you record every line item.
If you store data at a higher level you loose dimensionality.
You won't be able to filter by product.
Always store data at the lowest level of granularity because you never know what you will be asked to filter on.
We don't know how end users will filter the data or slice the data. you never know what kind of questions they will ask. and we want them to adopt the data model.
if you do this wrong you will have to start over.
what what where when that surrounds a business process.
