A Premium capacity workspace in Power BI is a dedicated server space, purchased by an organization, that allows for enhanced functionality and broader content sharing compared to standard workspaces. It enables users to access reports and dashboards without needing a Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license, provided they have the necessary permissions. Premium capacities offer increased refresh rates, larger datasets, and the ability to share content with users who don't have a Pro license.
