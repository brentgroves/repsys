## Learn how to configure the in-app channel

Novu extends beyond traditional notification channels like email, SMS, and push by providing a robust framework for in-app notifications. With Novu, you can build reliable, stateful systems that integrate seamlessly into your applications.

The inbox component and SDKs give you tools to create fully customizable, in-app notification experiences, including:

- Inboxes
- Floating feeds
- Toasts
- Banners

These components are designed to integrate cleanly into your architecture while being flexible enough to adapt to any design system or interaction model.
