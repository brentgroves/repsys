Power Query makes solving common data tasks easy. A lot of precious time is usually spent on repetitive manual work such as cut & paste tasks or combining columns and applying filters. The Power Query tool makes it a whole lot easier to perform such tasks.

An added benefit here is that Power Query is easy to use when compared to other BI tools. The Power Query interface is user-friendly. Since it is very similar to the Excel interface, many users will find it comfortable.

## What is Power Query?

Power Query is an application for transforming and preparing data. With Power Query you can get data from sources using a graphical interface and apply transformations using a Power Query Editor. Using Power Query, a business intelligence tool offered by Microsoft Excel, you can import data from any number of sources, clean it, transform it, then reshape it according to your needs. In this way, you can set up a query only once, re-use it later by simply refreshing.

As the name suggests, Power Query is the most powerful data automation tool found in Excel 2010 and later. Power Query allows a user to import data into Excel through external sources, such as Text files, CSV files, Web, or Excel workbooks, to list a few. The data can then be cleaned and prepared for our requirements.

Power Query has several useful features embedded in it, such as the appending of data and creating relationships between different data sets. This is called the merging of the data sets. We can also group and summarize data with the help of the tool. Needless to say, it is a very useful tool.
