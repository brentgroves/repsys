Dive into the Microsoft Fabric Medallion Architecture with a comprehensive case study. Understand its components and how it revolutionizes data management and analytics. Learn how this architecture provides robust solutions for handling large-scale data operations efficiently, transforming data strategy

## Introduction

In this Medium post, we will explore the transformative potential of the Microsoft Fabric Medallion Architecture. This architecture is designed to enhance data management and analytics, offering powerful solutions for handling large-scale data operations efficiently. We will delve into its intricate components and the substantial benefits it brings to modern data strategies. For a broader understanding of Microsoft Fabric and its comprehensive features, I recommend reading **[my previous Medium post](https://medium.com/@uzuntasgokberk/new-era-microsoft-fabric-e5b752d547f0)**, which provides an in-depth overview of its capabilities. By the end of this article, you’ll have a thorough understanding of how the Medallion Architecture can revolutionize your approach to data management

Apache Spark
Apache Spark commonly used in big data processing and analytics workflows.

Strengths of Apache Spark:

Known for super-fast processing
Distributed computing framework
Utilizes in-memory processing, reducing the need to read from slow disk storage
In Fabric deployment supported languages are Pyspark, Spark, Spark SQL and SparkR.
Extend beyond batch processing to handle real-time data streaming, machine learning etc.
How Apache Spark Works

Utilizes a cluster of machines(nodes) for distributed data and processing task
Efficiently processes large datasets by splitting them into smaller, manageable partitions.
Resilient Distributed Datasets(RDDs)

Core concept in Spark, serving as building blocks for data operations
Fault-tolerant, able to recover from errors or node failures by tracking data lineage
Advantages of RDDs

Ensures data integrity and reliability through fault tolerance
Optimizes data processing speed by storing as much as possible in memory
Cluster expansion is easy by adding more machines without significant code changes

The medallion architecture brings structure and efficiency to your lakehouse environment. This module guides you through its bronze, silver, and gold layers, ensuring you know how to organize, refine, and curate data effectively.

It aims to improve data quality as it moves through different layers. The architecture typically has three layers — bronze (raw), silver (validated), and gold (enriched), each representing higher data quality levels. Each layer indicates the quality of data stored in the lakehouse, with higher levels representing higher quality.

This architecture ensures that data is reliable and consistent as it goes through various checks and changes. It also guarantees that the data is safely stored in a way that makes it easier and faster to analyze.

Bronze (raw): The raw zone, which is the first layer that stores source data in its original format.

Silver (validated): The enriched zone, where raw data is cleansed and standardized. At this stage, data is structured with rows and columns.Transformations at the silver level should focus on data quality and consistency, not on data modeling.

Gold (enriched): The refined zone, where data is “business ready” and meets analytical and business requirements.

Medallion Architecture Case Details
The data source is formula data located outside fabric which is Azure Data Lake Gen2 and with this example, constructing a medallion architecture within a Fabric lakehouse utilizing notebooks. Our process will involve setting up a workspace and three lakehouses. We’ll link the bronze layer to the landing zone using shortcuts, perform data transformations, and load the results into the silver Delta table. Further data transformations will be conducted before loading into the gold Delta tables. Finally, we’ll explore the semantic model and establish relationships.

Setting Up and Managing Data Connections
When you created a workspace do not forget in Power BI Section Data Model Settings “Users can edit data models in the Power BI Service” that will enable you to create relationships between tables in your lakehouse using a Power BI dataset.
