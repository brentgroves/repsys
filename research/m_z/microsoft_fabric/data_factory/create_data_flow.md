Dataflows are a self-service, cloud-based, data preparation technology. In this article, you create your first dataflow, get data for your dataflow, then transform the data and publish the dataflow.

Prerequisites
The following prerequisites are required before you start:

A Microsoft Fabric tenant account with an active subscription. Create a free account.
Make sure you have a Microsoft Fabric enabled Workspace: Create a workspace.

Apply transformations and publish
You loaded your data into your first dataflow. Congratulations! Now it's time to apply a couple of transformations to bring this data into the shape we need.

Make sure the Data Profiling tools are turned on. Go to Home > Options > Global Options, then select all the options under Column profile.
