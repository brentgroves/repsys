ETL and ELT are the most widely used methods in data engineering for delivering information from one or many sources to a centralized system for easy access and analysis. Both consist of the extract, transform, and load stages. The distinction is based on the order of events. While you might think that a slight change in the stage sequence would have no impact, it makes a world of difference to the integration flow.

In this post, we'll dive deep into the explanation of ETL vs ELT processes and compare them against essential criteria so you can decide which is best suited for your data pipeline.

ETL and ELT overview
As we mentioned before, ETL and ELT are the two ways to integrate data into a single location. The primary difference resides in WHERE and WHEN data transformation and loading happens. With ETL, data is transformed in a temporary staging area before it gets to a target repository (e.g., an enterprise data warehouse) whereas ELT makes it possible to transform data after it's loaded into a target system (cloud data warehouses or data lakes). Why does it matter so much? Letâ€™s figure it out.

## What is ETL?

ETL is the initialism for extraction, transformation, and loading. It is the process of collecting raw data from disparate sources, transmitting it to a staging database for conversion, and loading prepared data into a unified destination system.

ETL tools are used for data integration to meet the requirements of relational database management systems and/or traditional data warehouses that support OLAP (online analytical processing). OLAP tools and structured query language (SQL) queries need data sets to be structured and standardized through a series of transformations that happen before data gets into a warehouse.
