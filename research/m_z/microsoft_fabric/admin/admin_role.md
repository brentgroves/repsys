# **[Understand the Fabric administrator role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/administer-fabric/3-admin-role-tools)**

Now that you understand the Fabric architecture and what you and your team might use Fabric for, let's look at the admin role and the tools used to manage the platform.

There are several roles that work together to administer Microsoft Fabric for your organization. If you're a Microsoft 365 admin, a Power Platform admin, or a Fabric capacity admin, you're involved in administering Fabric. The Fabric admin role was formerly known as Power BI admin.

As a Fabric admin, you work primarily in the Fabric admin portal. You might also need to familiarize yourself with the following tools:

Microsoft 365 admin center
Microsoft 365 Security & Microsoft Purview compliance portal
Microsoft Entra ID in the Azure portal
PowerShell cmdlets
Administrative APIs and SDK

## Describe admin tasks

As an admin, you might be responsible for a wide range of tasks to keep the Fabric platform running smoothly. These tasks include:

Security and access control: One of the most important aspects of Fabric administration is managing security and access control to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data. You can use role-based access control (RBAC) to:

- Define who can view and edit content.
- Set up data gateways to securely connect to on-premises data sources.
- Manage user access with Microsoft Entra ID.
