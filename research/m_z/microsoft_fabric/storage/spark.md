Hadoop and Spark are both open-source big data processing frameworks, but they differ significantly in their approach to data processing. Hadoop, primarily known for its HDFS (storage) and MapReduce (processing), is well-suited for large batch processing jobs. Spark, on the other hand, excels in speed and versatility, offering in-memory processing, real-time streaming, and a wider range of processing capabilities including machine learning and graph processing

Here's a more detailed comparison:
Hadoop (HDFS & MapReduce):
Storage:
Hadoop's HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) provides a distributed file system for storing massive datasets across a cluster of machines.
Processing:
Hadoop's MapReduce framework processes data in batches, breaking down large jobs into smaller tasks that are executed in parallel across the cluster.
Strengths:
Hadoop is robust, fault-tolerant, and cost-effective for handling very large, static datasets. It's well-suited for batch processing of historical data.
Limitations:
Hadoop's performance can be slower than Spark, particularly for iterative and interactive workloads, because data is read from and written to disk during processing.
Use Cases:
Batch processing of large datasets, data warehousing, and archival storage.
Spark:
Processing:
Spark offers in-memory processing, which significantly speeds up computations, especially for iterative algorithms and interactive queries.
Strengths:
Spark is much faster than Hadoop for many workloads due to its in-memory processing and optimized query execution.
Versatility:
Spark supports various processing types, including batch processing, streaming, machine learning, and graph processing.
Ease of Use:
Spark provides user-friendly APIs in multiple languages (Scala, Java, Python, R), making it easier for developers to build applications.
Use Cases:
Real-time data processing, machine learning, interactive analytics, and graph processing.
Storage:
While Spark can integrate with HDFS, it also supports other storage systems and cloud-based storage.
Resource Management:
Spark can leverage YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) for resource management, similar to Hadoop, but also supports other resource managers like Kubernetes.
