A data warehouse is a central repository for a company's historical data, serving as a single source of truth for all departments and business functions. A data mart, on the other hand, is a smaller, focused subset of a data warehouse, tailored to the specific needs of a particular department or business unit. Think of a data warehouse as a large, comprehensive library, while a data mart is a specialized section within that library, focusing on a particular subject area.
