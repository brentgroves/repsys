# power query template

A Power Query template is a file that encapsulates the Power Query script (M code) and its associated metadata for a specific Power Query project. This template can include all the queries, transformations, functions, and parameters defined within the Power Query Editor.
Key characteristics and uses of Power Query templates:
Portability and Reusability:
Templates allow users to save and reuse Power Query solutions across different platforms (e.g., Excel, Power BI, Dataflows in Fabric) or to share them with other users. This eliminates the need to recreate complex transformations from scratch.
Consistency:
By using a template, you can ensure that the same data cleaning and transformation steps are applied consistently to new datasets.
Efficiency:
Templates streamline the process of setting up new data imports or analyses by providing a pre-configured set of queries and transformations.
Version Control:
While not a full version control system, templates can be used to manage different versions of your Power Query solutions, allowing you to revert to previous configurations if needed.
How to create and use them:
Exporting: In the Power Query Editor (e.g., in Excel or a Dataflow), you can typically find an option to "Export Template" under the "File" menu. This will save your Power Query project as a .pqt file.
Importing: You can then import this .pqt file into a new Power Query instance (e.g., in another Excel workbook, a new Power BI report, or a Dataflow) to load all the pre-defined queries and transformations. Note that you may need to reconfigure data source credentials after importing.
