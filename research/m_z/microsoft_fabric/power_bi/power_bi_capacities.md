# **[What are Power BI capacities?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/embedded/embedded-analytics-power-bi#what-are-power-bi-capacities)**

A capacity is a set of resources reserved for exclusive use. It enables you to publish dashboards, reports, and semantic models to users, without having to purchase per-user licenses. It also offers dependable, consistent performance for your content.
For development testing, you can use free embed trial tokens with a Pro license. To embed in a production environment, you must use a capacity.

## Important

Free trial tokens are limited to development testing only. For production, a capacity must be purchased. Until a capacity is purchased, the Free trial version banner continues to appear at the top of the embedded report.
