Power BI semantic models are the underlying structures that define how data is organized, related, and used in Power BI reports and dashboards. They represent a single source of truth, consolidating data, relationships, measures, and security settings into a reusable model. This allows for consistent reporting and analysis across multiple reports and dashboards.

This video provides a comprehensive explanation of what a semantic model is in Power BI and Microsoft Fabric:

Here's a more detailed explanation:
Purpose:
Semantic models simplify the complexity of raw data, making it understandable and usable for business users. They act as an intermediary between data sources and the visual reports created in Power BI.
Key Components:
Semantic models include:
Data: The actual data from various sources, organized into tables.
Relationships: Definitions of how different tables are connected, allowing for analysis across multiple datasets.
Calculations (Measures): Defined calculations and aggregations that can be used in reports, often written in Data Analysis Expressions (DAX).
Security: Row-level security (RLS) rules that control which users can see specific data.

Benefits:
Single Source of Truth: Semantic models ensure consistency by providing a unified view of data for all reports.
Improved Performance: Efficiently organized and pre-aggregated data can improve report performance.
Reduced Redundancy: Multiple reports can leverage the same semantic model, avoiding the need to duplicate data and calculations.
Enhanced Security: Row-level security (RLS) can be implemented to control data access.

Creation:
Semantic models can be created by:
Connecting to existing data models.
Uploading Power BI Desktop files.
Using the Power BI service to create push or streaming semantic models.

Usage:
Power BI reports and dashboards are built on top of semantic models. When a report is created, it connects to a specific semantic model, using its defined data, relationships, and calculations.
