Manage an on-premises data gateway
06/13/2025
After you install an on-premises data gateway, you manage it based on your requirements. Because each service might integrate gateways differently, the management options differ depending on the service.

## Note

Manage gateways doesn't show up until you're the admin of at least one gateway. You become an admin either by being added as an admin or because you installed and configured a gateway.
