Refresh data from an on-premises SQL Server database
09/06/2024
In this tutorial, you explore how to refresh a Power BI semantic model from a relational database that exists on premises in your local network. Specifically, this tutorial uses a sample SQL Server database, which Power BI must access through an on-premises data gateway.

In this tutorial, you complete the following steps:

- Create and publish a Power BI Desktop .pbix file that imports data from an on-premises SQL Server database.
- Configure data source and semantic model settings in Power BI for SQL Server connectivity through a data gateway.
- Configure a refresh schedule to ensure your Power BI semantic model has recent data.
- Do an on-demand refresh of your semantic model.
- Review the refresh history to analyze the outcomes of past refresh cycles.
- Clean up resources by deleting the items you created in this tutorial.
