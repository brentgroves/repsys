The following table contains a list of all the connectors currently available for Power Query. For those connectors that have a reference page in this document, a link is provided under the connector icon and name.

A checkmark indicates the connector is currently supported in the listed service; an X indicates that the connector is not currently supported in the listed service.

The connectors are listed in alphabetical order in separate tables for each letter in the alphabet. Use the In this article list on the right side of this article to go to any of the alphabetized tables. Go to Supported Azure data services to learn more about which connectors are supported by the VNET data gateway.

 Note

The Excel column in the following table indicates all connectors that are available on at least one version of Excel. However, not all Excel versions support all of these indicated Power Query connectors. For a complete list of the Power Query connectors supported by all versions of Excel, go to **[Power Query data sources in Excel versions](https://support.microsoft.com/office/power-query-data-sources-in-excel-versions-e9332067-8e49-46fc-97ff-f2e1bfa0cb16)**.

 Note

There's a known issue resulting in an Expression.Error: The import [connector name] matches no exports error where connectors requiring a gateway aren't working in dataflows and datamarts in Premium workspaces. There's ongoing work towards a fix and the documentation will be updated when a fix is released.
