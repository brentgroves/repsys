## Power BI data sources

09/06/2024
This article provides general information on Power BI data sources including considerations, limitations, and links to additional resources.

Power BI uses Power Query to connect to data sources. Power BI data sources are documented in the following article: **[Power Query (including Power BI) connectors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/connectors/)**.

Each data source article in the Power Query documentation describes the capabilities of the data connector, such as whether DirectQuery is supported. The following image shows the Capabilities supported section for **[Azure Data Explorer (Kusto)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/connectors/azure-data-explorer#capabilities-supported)**, where it states that DirectQuery is supported for the connector in Power BI. If DirectQuery (or any other capability) isn't listed, the capability isn't supported.
