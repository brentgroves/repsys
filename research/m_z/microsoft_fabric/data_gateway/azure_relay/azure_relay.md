# **[Set the Azure Relay for on-premises data gateway](<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-azure-relay>)**

During installation of the on-premises data gateway, the Azure Relays are automatically provisioned. However, you can also provide your own relay details. These details help you associate the relay with your Azure subscription and also manage the sender and listener keys for this relay.

 Note

Only WCF relays with NetTcp type are supported for this feature.

 Warning

Azure Relay configured with Private Link isn't supported.
