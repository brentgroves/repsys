Some of the on-premises data gateway app features can be used only after you sign in to your Office 365 account. For example, under the Service Settings tab, you can restart the gateway without signing in, but you can't change the service account of your gateway without signing in.

 Note

Each cloud service that supports the gateway has its own administrative management page where you can configure the gateway and connections for use by that service. For more details, go to **[Manage an on-premises data gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-manage)**.
