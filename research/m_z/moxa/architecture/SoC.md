# **[What is a System on a Chip (SoC)?](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-system-on-a-chip.html)**

Definition
A system on a chip (SoC) is an integrated circuit (IC) that combines all of a system’s essential components onto a single piece of silicon, eliminating the need for separate, bulky system parts. This integration simplifies circuit board design and delivers improved power efficiency and speed without compromising functionality.

Components contained within an SoC can include:

- Data processing units
- Embedded memory
- Graphics processing units (GPUs)
- USB interfaces
- Video and audio processing

In electronics, the priority is always “more performance, less power, and less space.” This is especially critical for portable devices such as tablets and smartphones, where advanced technology must fit within the smallest possible footprint and consume minimal power. By consolidating all necessary elements into a single package, SoCs enable engineers to create devices that are both fast and compact.

Compact SoCs have become indispensable solutions across various markets, ranging from wired applications like data centers, artificial intelligence (AI), and high-performance computing (HPC) to battery-operated devices such as mobile phones and wearables.

## Understanding the Components and Construction of SoCs

As the name implies, system-on-chip contains nearly all the necessary functional circuit blocks for a full system on a single chip. Generally, you will find the following components on any SoC:

- Multiple Cores: A processor with multiple cores in the form of a microcontroller, microprocessor, digital signal processor, or application-specific instruction set processor.
- Memory Capabilities: Memory capabilities such as RAM, ROM, FLASH, EEPROM, and/or cache memory.
- External Interfaces: External interfaces for wired communication protocols such as HDMI, USB4, FireWire, USART, SPI, I²C, or Ethernet.
- Wireless Capabilities: Wireless capabilities such as WiFi or Bluetooth and other radio frequency capabilities.
- GPU: A Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) for accelerating specific tasks.
- Voltage Regulation: Voltage regulators, phase lock loop (PLL) control systems, built-in oscillators, timers, and analog-to-digital (ADC) converters.
- Intrachip Communication: Intrachip communication subsystems for connecting individual circuit blocks, such as Interface busses or newer intercommunication networks known as networks-on-chip (NoC).
- Signal Processing: Digital, analog, and mixed-signal processing circuit blocks for any sensors, actuators, data collection, and data analysis.
- Next-Gen Capabilities: SoC capabilities powering the next generation.

Generally, engineers want to reduce energy waste, save on spending, and further miniaturize devices. With system-on-chip technology, this is possible through advanced integration methods on a single IC.

These compact and versatile chips have powered the rise of smartphones, allowing for incredible power in a small form factor. Similarly, due to their compact and power-efficient qualities, manufacturers are incorporating SoCs into new IoT devices, embedded systems, and even automobiles.

Furthermore, we’ve also seen a shift in SoC technology used in personal computers and laptops to further reduce power consumption and improve performance. Less circuit real estate generally results in less heat generation, less power consumption, and a lower cost of production. This has allowed more efficient device design for heat distribution, minimal latency, and accelerated data transmission.

Because SoCs are highly specialized, they are often applied in individualized tasks. Custom SoCs are now being developed for specific applications such as enhancing machine learning, advanced AI capabilities, and high-performance cloud computing with faster data processing. SoCs can perform multiple calculations as a distributed operation (rather than the limited parallelism offered by traditional CPUs) to further accelerate calculations. For this reason, many companies are now investing in their own development of custom SoCs to support their advanced data and signal processing needs.

## The History of SoCs

With smaller devices so common in our everyday lives, it’s hard to imagine a time when SoCs weren’t in everything. But it wasn’t until the 1970s that the concept of fitting an entire system onto a single microchip first became a reality.

- 1970s: According to the Computer History Museum, the first system on a chip appeared in an LCD watch in 1974. Until then, microprocessors had only been standalone chips that required the support of external chips.
- 1980s-90s: Advancements in semiconductor manufacturing technology made it possible to integrate more components on a single chip. Mixed-signal integration allowed chips to process both analog and digital signals.
- 2000-2010s: SoCs began integrating Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular modems, bringing wireless communications to our mobile devices. The addition of powerful processors and graphics capabilities helped make smartphones a new way of life.
- Present: SoCs are becoming increasingly specialized and are expanding beyond mobile to include automotive systems, wearable devices, industrial automation, and more. New features include artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and edge computing.
