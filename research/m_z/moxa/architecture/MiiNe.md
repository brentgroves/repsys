Moxa’s MiiNePort E3 Series embedded device servers are designed for manufacturers who want to add sophisticated network connectivity to their serial devices with minimal integration effort. The MiiNePort E3 is empowered by the MiiNe, Moxa’s second-generation SoC, which supports 10/100 Mbps Ethernet, up to 921.6 kbps serial baudrate, a versatile selection of ready-to-use operation modes, and requires only a small amount of power. By using Moxa’s innovative NetEZ technology, the MiiNePort E3 can be used to convert any device with a standard serial interface to an Ethernet-enabled device in no time. In addition, the MiiNePort E3 is a compact embedded device server with an RJ45 connector, making it easy to fit into virtually any existing serial device.

## Moxa’s Second-generation SoC

The MiiNe was created to provide manufacturers with a competitive embedded serial-to-Ethernet solution. The MiiNePort E3, which uses the MiiNe for its SoC, is a compact embedded device server that has the lowest power consumption among similar products. The MiiNe has the following features:

- Designed for serial-to-Ethernet applications
- Uses an Arm core
- Uses Moxa’s own advanced UART technology
- 2 MB Flash and 4 MB SDRAM memory built in
