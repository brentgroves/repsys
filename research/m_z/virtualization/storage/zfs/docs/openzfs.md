## Checksums and Their Use in ZFSÔÉÅ

End-to-end checksums are a key feature of ZFS and an important differentiator for ZFS over other RAID implementations and filesystems. Advantages of end-to-end checksums include:

detects data corruption upon reading from media

blocks that are detected as corrupt are automatically repaired if possible, by using the RAID protection in suitably configured pools, or redundant copies (see the zfs copies property)

periodic scrubs can check data to detect and repair latent media degradation (bit rot) and corruption from other sources

checksums on ZFS replication streams, zfs send and zfs receive, ensure the data received is not corrupted by intervening storage or transport mechanisms
