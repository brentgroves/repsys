# s3 create temporary bucket link

AI Overview
To create a temporary link for an Amazon S3 object, you use a presigned URL. This URL grants temporary access to a specific S3 object without requiring the recipient to have AWS credentials or direct S3 permissions.
Here's how you can generate a presigned URL:
Locate the S3 object:
Identify the specific object within your S3 bucket for which you want to create a temporary link.
Generate the presigned URL:
AWS Management Console: Navigate to the S3 object in the console, select it, and then choose the option to "Create presigned URL" or "Generate presigned URL." You can set the expiration time directly in the console (e.g., minutes, hours).
AWS CLI: Use the aws s3 presign command, specifying the S3 URI of the object and the desired expiration time in seconds using the --expires-in parameter.
Code

```bash
aws s3 presign s3://your-bucket-name/your-object-key --expires-in 3600
aws s3 presign s3://your-bucket-name/your-object-key --expires-in 3600

BUCKET_NAME=buckebasic
RGW_ENDPOINT=http://10.188.50.201

aws --profile rgwuser-basic --endpoint-url ${RGW_ENDPOINT} s3 presign s3://buckebasic/testfile --expires-in 3600


BUCKET_NAME=buckebasic
RGW_ENDPOINT=http://10.188.50.201


aws --profile rgwuser-basic --endpoint-url ${RGW_ENDPOINT} s3api list-objects --bucket ${BUCKET_NAME}

aws --profile rgwuser-basic --endpoint-url http://10.188.50.201 s3 ls buckebasic

aws --profile user --endpoint-url http://10.188.50.201 s3 ls
2025-07-18 18:19:25 mybucket
2025-08-04 15:22:37 mybucket2

aws --profile user --endpoint-url http://10.188.50.201 s3 ls mybucket

```

(This example sets an expiration of 3600 seconds, or 1 hour.)
AWS SDKs: Utilize the S3 client in your preferred programming language's AWS SDK to generate a presigned URL programmatically. You'll typically specify the bucket name, object key, HTTP method (e.g., GET for download), and the expiration time.
Share the URL: Copy the generated presigned URL and share it with the intended recipient. They can use this URL to access the S3 object for the specified duration.
Key characteristics of presigned URLs:
Expiration:
The URL is valid only for the duration you specify during creation. After this time, the URL will no longer grant access.
Permissions:
The URL inherits the permissions of the user who generated it, but only for the specific action (e.g., GET, PUT) and object defined.
Security:
Presigned URLs offer a secure way to share S3 objects temporarily without exposing your AWS credentials or making the bucket publicly accessible.
