# **[public traffic]()**

In a Ceph storage cluster, public traffic refers to the network communication between Ceph clients (like virtual machines or applications) and the Ceph storage cluster, as well as communication between different Ceph daemons. It's essentially the "front-side" network, handling client requests and data access.

Key aspects of Ceph public traffic:

## Client-to-Cluster Communication

This is the primary role of the public network. Clients (e.g., VMs using RBD or applications accessing CephFS) use the public network to interact with the storage cluster, sending read and write requests.

## Daemon-to-Daemon Communication

Ceph daemons, like OSDs (Object Storage Devices), monitors, and managers, also communicate over the public network, especially when a separate cluster network isn't configured.

## Default Configuration

If you don't explicitly configure a separate cluster network, all Ceph traffic, including replication and recovery traffic between OSDs, will flow over the public network.

## Performance Considerations

While a public network is sufficient for basic Ceph deployments, a separate cluster network can significantly improve performance, especially in larger clusters, by offloading replication and recovery traffic from the public network.

## Security Considerations

Separating traffic onto different networks can enhance security by isolating critical Ceph operations from potentially vulnerable client traffic.
