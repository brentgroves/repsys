To use the Ceph CLI to manage a remote Ceph cluster, the client machine needs to be configured to connect to that cluster. This involves providing the necessary configuration and authentication details.

## Steps to configure Ceph CLI for a remote cluster

Obtain the remote cluster's configuration files:
**ceph.conf:** This file contains the cluster's configuration, including monitor addresses and network settings.
**Keyring file (e.g., ceph.client.admin.keyring):** This file contains the authentication key for a Ceph user (e.g., client.admin) that has the necessary permissions to interact with the cluster.

Place the configuration files on the client machine:

- The standard location for these files is /etc/ceph/. You can copy the ceph.conf and keyring files into this directory on your client machine.
- Alternatively, you can specify the paths to these files using command-line arguments when executing Ceph commands.

Execute Ceph commands, specifying the remote cluster's details:

- If the configuration files are in /etc/ceph/, you can often run Ceph commands directly (e.g., ceph -s). The CLI will automatically detect the configuration.
- If the configuration files are in a different location, or if you need to specify a particular cluster when multiple configurations exist, use the -c and -k flags:

```bash
ceph -c /path/to/remote/ceph.conf -k /path/to/remote/ceph.client.admin.keyring -s
```

Replace /path/to/remote/ceph.conf and /path/to/remote/ceph.client.admin.keyring with the actual paths to your remote cluster's configuration and keyring files.
