# can we configure multisite backup with microceph

## AI Overview

Yes, you can configure multisite backups with MicroCeph, leveraging the replication capabilities of the underlying Ceph technology it orchestrates. However, the process is not automatic and requires configuring Ceph's native replication features for your specific storage types (Object, Block, or File).
MicroCeph is a lightweight tool that simplifies the deployment and management of a Ceph cluster, and it exposes the standard Ceph features for more advanced configurations like multisite replication. The best approach for your "backup" configuration depends on whether you are using object, block, or file storage.

## Multisite backup options with MicroCeph

## Object storage (S3) via Ceph Object Gateway (RGW)

For backing up S3-compatible object data across multiple sites, you will use Ceph's built-in RGW multisite replication. This creates an asynchronous, eventually consistent replica of your object data on a second independent Ceph cluster.

How it works:

- You configure a "realm" and "zonegroup" to define the scope of your replication.
- Each MicroCeph cluster is configured as a "zone" within the zonegroup.
- One zone is designated as the master, and the other is a secondary, where data is replicated.
- The replication is asynchronous, meaning there is a non-zero Recovery Point Objective (RPO).

Command: Use the microceph.ceph rgw command-line interface to set up realms, zonegroups, and zones, just as you would with a standard Ceph installation.

## Block storage (RBD) mirroring

For replicating block devices, MicroCeph supports the native Ceph RBD mirroring feature. This sets up asynchronous, image-based replication between two independent Ceph clusters.

How it works:
RBD mirroring is configured on either a per-image or per-pool basis.

It is an asynchronous process, so the replicas at the backup site may be slightly out of sync.

Command: MicroCeph provides direct commands to configure RBD mirroring:

```bash
microceph replication enable rbd [resource]
microceph replication configure rbd [resource]
```

## Key considerations for multisite backups

**Requires two MicroCeph clusters:** Multisite replication, by definition, requires at least two separate Ceph clusters. While MicroCeph simplifies cluster setup, you will need to deploy and manage two distinct MicroCeph clusters.
**Independent clusters:** Unlike a Ceph "stretch cluster" that performs synchronous replication across sites (and is sensitive to WAN latency), multisite object and RBD replication use independent clusters. This makes it more resilient to higher latencies and more suitable for disaster recovery over wide-area networks.
**Asynchronous replication:** This means the backup is not real-time, but slightly delayed. The Recovery Point Objective (RPO) will be determined by the replication frequency.
**Native Ceph features:** MicroCeph provides the simplified management layer, but the core replication functionality comes from the underlying Ceph services (RGW, RBD). You should refer to the standard Ceph documentation for detailed configuration and tuning of these features.
