AI Overview
Mounting a Ceph RGW S3 bucket involves using tools that can interact with the S3 API to present the object storage as a local filesystem. While Ceph RGW provides an S3-compatible interface for object storage, directly "mounting" it like a traditional block device or network file system (NFS/CIFS) is not native. Instead, tools are used to bridge the gap and provide a local filesystem view of the S3 bucket.
Here are common methods for achieving this:
S3FS-FUSE:
S3FS-FUSE is a FUSE-based file system that allows mounting an S3 bucket as a local directory.
It translates file system operations (like creating, reading, writing files) into S3 API calls.
This provides a convenient way to interact with S3 objects as if they were regular files on a local disk.
Rclone:
Rclone is a command-line program that can sync files and directories to and from various cloud storage providers, including S3-compatible services like Ceph RGW.
It also offers a mount command that allows mounting a remote S3 bucket as a local filesystem using FUSE.
Rclone is versatile and supports various S3 features.
Goofys:
Goofys is another FUSE-based file system for S3 that focuses on performance and correctness.
It aims to provide a more performant alternative to s3fs-fuse for certain workloads.
General Steps for Mounting a Ceph RGW S3 Bucket:
Install the chosen tool: Install s3fs-fuse, rclone, or goofys on the system where the S3 bucket needs to be mounted.
Configure credentials: Provide the necessary S3 access key and secret key for the Ceph RGW user with access to the target bucket. This can often be done through environment variables, configuration files, or command-line arguments.
Specify the endpoint: Configure the tool to point to the Ceph RGW endpoint URL, which is the address of the Ceph RGW service.
Execute the mount command: Use the specific mount command provided by the chosen tool, specifying the S3 bucket name and the local mount point directory.
Example using s3fs-fuse:
Code

s3fs my-ceph-bucket /mnt/s3_mountpoint -o url=http://<rgw_endpoint_ip>:<port>,passwd_file=/path/to/credentials_file
Example using rclone:
Code

rclone mount my-ceph-remote:my-ceph-bucket /mnt/s3_mountpoint --vfs-cache-mode full
These tools provide the functionality to "mount" Ceph RGW S3 buckets, enabling interaction with the object storage through a familiar filesystem interface.
