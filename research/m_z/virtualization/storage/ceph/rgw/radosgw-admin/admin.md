## Admin Guide

After the Ceph Object Storage service is up and running, it can be administered with user management, access controls, quotas, and usage tracking.

User Management
Ceph Object Storage user management refers only to users of the Ceph Object Storage service and not to the Ceph Object Gateway as a user of the Ceph Storage Cluster. Create a user, access key, and secret key to enable end users to interact with Ceph Object Gateway services. Optionally, the users can belong to Accounts for ease of management.
