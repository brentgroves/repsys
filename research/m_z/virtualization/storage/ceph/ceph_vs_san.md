# is ceph a san

While Ceph can be used to create a software-defined storage area network (SAN), it's not inherently a SAN in itself. Ceph is a distributed storage system that can provide block, file, and object storage. It can be used to build a SAN-like infrastructure using commodity hardware, but it's more flexible and scalable than traditional hardware-based SANs, according to Virtualization Howto.
Here's a more detailed explanation:
Traditional SANs
are hardware-based and typically rely on specialized storage servers, high-speed networks (like Fibre Channel), and RAID configurations for data redundancy. They are often expensive and vendor-specific.
Ceph
is a software-defined storage solution, meaning it runs on standard servers and uses a network (usually TCP/IP) to connect them. It provides data replication across multiple nodes, eliminating the need for RAID and offering greater scalability and fault tolerance.
Ceph can be used to build a SAN
by exposing block storage (using RADOS Block Device - RBD) over iSCSI, creating a SAN-like environment with commodity hardware. However, Ceph is also capable of handling file and object storage, making it a more versatile solution than traditional SANs.
Key distinctions:
Ceph focuses on software-defined storage using commodity hardware, while SANs typically use specialized hardware. Ceph emphasizes data replication and distribution, while SANs often rely on RAID for redundancy. Ceph is designed for scalability and fault tolerance, while traditional SANs can be more complex and expensive.
