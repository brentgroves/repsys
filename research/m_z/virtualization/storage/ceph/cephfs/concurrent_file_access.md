## AI Overview

Ceph File System (CephFS) is designed to support concurrent file access from multiple clients while maintaining POSIX compliance where possible. This is achieved through several key mechanisms:
Metadata Servers (MDS): MDS daemons manage the file system's metadata, including directory structures, file permissions, and file layouts. They coordinate access to shared files and ensure cache coherency across clients.
Capabilities and Locks: When a client needs to read or write a file, it requests capabilities from the MDS. Once granted, the client can directly access the RADOS (Reliable Autonomic Distributed Object Store) layer to perform data operations. For concurrent access, MDS uses locking mechanisms to manage shared access and prevent data corruption. For example, wrlock allows multiple writers concurrently, particularly when a large directory is fragmented and handled by different active MDSs.
Data Striping: CephFS stripes file data across multiple RADOS objects and placement groups, distributing the workload and improving performance, especially for large files and concurrent operations.
Cache Coherency: CephFS aims to maintain strong cache coherency across clients, ensuring that all clients see a consistent view of the file system, similar to how processes on a single host would behave.
High Availability: CephFS supports multiple active MDS servers, which can take over if one fails, ensuring continuous availability of the file system even during server outages.
While CephFS generally provides robust support for concurrent file access, specific implementations like the Ceph SQLite VFS might have limitations, such as not yet supporting concurrent readers for database files, as indicated in the documentation.
