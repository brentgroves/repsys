Windows file sharing modes refer to the permissions you set when sharing a folder or file over a local network, which can be Read only or Read/Write access for specific users or the "Everyone" group. The system relies on the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol for this function, and you configure these modes through the "Properties" menu under the "Sharing" tab, typically using the "Advanced Sharing" settings for greater control over who can access your files and what they can do with them.
