# secure boot windows fails with work account but succeeds with personal account

When Windows Secure Boot fails with a work account but succeeds with a personal account, it is typically not an account issue but a device configuration or management problem. The device likely has security policies, such as Microsoft Intune or Group Policy, applied by your organization that interfere with the boot process or require specific security configurations.
Potential causes
Intune compliance policies: Companies use Intune to enforce strict security policies on work devices. A policy could be requiring a feature that is not properly configured, causing a Secure Boot failure.
Disabled security processor (TPM): Some corporate security settings rely on the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) for enhanced security features. If the TPM is not enabled, or its configuration was reset, it can cause authentication and boot failures.
Outdated BIOS/firmware: Outdated or corrupted system firmware (BIOS/UEFI) can sometimes cause conflicts with Windows updates or corporate security settings. This can result in Secure Boot failures for reasons that are not immediately obvious.
Corrupted TPM keys: If the cryptographic keys stored in the TPM become corrupted, they can no longer be used to verify the integrity of the boot process, causing Secure Boot to fail.
Software conflicts: Some security systems, such as antivirus, firewalls, or VPNs, can interfere with the authentication process, particularly for Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) accounts. This is often tied to the Microsoft Office 365 Trusted Platform Module (TPM) error.
