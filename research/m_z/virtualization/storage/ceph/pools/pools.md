# **[Ceph Pools]()**

AI Overview
A Ceph pool is a logical partition within a Ceph storage cluster that acts as an interface for clients to store and access data objects. Pools are crucial for data durability and performance because they define how data is stored and protected, using either replication or erasure coding to ensure data isn't lost if hardware fails. By creating different pools, administrators can organize data, apply specific policies like access controls, and separate different types of data, such as those for Ceph Block Devices or Ceph Object Gateways.
