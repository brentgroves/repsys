# swift

OpenStack Swift, commonly known as Swift, is an open-source object storage system designed for storing and retrieving large amounts of unstructured data. While object storage systems like Swift are often described as having a "flat" address space, they can provide a simulated hierarchical structure through the use of object names.
Simulated Hierarchy in Swift:
Containers:
.
In Swift, data is organized into "containers," which are analogous to buckets or top-level directories.
Object Naming Conventions:
.
The hierarchical appearance is achieved by using forward slashes (/) within object names to represent nested "directories." For example, an object named myfolder/mysubfolder/myfile.txt would appear to be located within mysubfolder, which is itself within myfolder.
No True Directory Structure:
.
It is crucial to understand that these "folders" are not actual directories in the traditional file system sense. They are merely part of the object's name, and the underlying storage system treats each object as a single, independent entity with a unique identifier.
API Interactions:
.
When interacting with Swift via its API, you specify the full object name, including the simulated path, to retrieve or store data.
In essence, while Swift is fundamentally a flat object storage system, it offers the flexibility to organize and access data in a way that mimics a hierarchical structure through intelligent naming conventions. This allows users to manage their data in a familiar, organized manner despite the underlying flat architecture.
