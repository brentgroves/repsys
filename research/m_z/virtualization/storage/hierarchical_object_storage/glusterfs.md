GlusterFS is primarily a distributed file system, not a hierarchical object storage system. While it can be used to store objects, its core architecture is based on a hierarchical file system structure with directories and subdirectories. Object storage, in contrast, uses a flat structure where data is stored as objects with unique identifiers, not within a hierarchical directory structure.
Here's a more detailed explanation:
GlusterFS as a File System:
.
GlusterFS organizes data in a hierarchical manner, similar to traditional file systems. Files are stored within directories, which can contain subdirectories, creating a tree-like structure.
Object Storage:
.
Object storage, on the other hand, uses a flat namespace. Data is stored as objects, each with a unique identifier, and these objects are stored in a flat storage pool, without the concept of directories or hierarchical organization.
GlusterFS and Object Storage:
.
While GlusterFS can be used to store objects, it does so by storing them as files within its hierarchical file system. This means that the object storage paradigm is not native to GlusterFS.
Benefits of Object Storage:
.
Object storage is known for its scalability, allowing for the storage of large amounts of unstructured data, and for its ability to easily handle billions of objects.
GlusterFS Benefits:
.
GlusterFS offers features like data replication and geo-replication for reliability and availability, and it excels in distributed storage environments according to Wikipedia.
