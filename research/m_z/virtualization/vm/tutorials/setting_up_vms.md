Virtualization technology has become an indispensable tool in software development, testing, and deployment. It allows you to run multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical machine, each with its own isolated operating system and resources. This tutorial focuses on setting up a virtualization environment on Debian or Ubuntu Linux using QEMU, KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine), and Virt-Manager.

In this tutorial you will learn:

How to update your Debian or Ubuntu system.
The process of installing QEMU, KVM, and Virt-Manager.
How to add your user to the necessary groups to manage VMs without root privileges.
Steps to verify the installation and manage virtual machines with Virt-Manager.
