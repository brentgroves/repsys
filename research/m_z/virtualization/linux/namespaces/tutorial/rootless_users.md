A Linux rootless user, in the context of containerization technologies like Docker or Podman, refers to running the container daemon and its associated containers as a non-root user on the host system. This contrasts with the traditional "rootful" mode where the daemon and containers operate with root privileges.

Key aspects of rootless mode:

## Enhanced Security

Running as a non-root user significantly reduces the potential attack surface. If a vulnerability exists within the container runtime or a containerized application, it is contained within the user's namespace and cannot directly compromise the entire host system with root privileges.

## User Namespaces

Rootless mode leverages user namespaces, a Linux kernel feature that allows unprivileged users to create isolated environments where they can map host UIDs/GIDs to different UIDs/GIDs within the namespace. This enables a user inside the container to appear as root within that isolated environment, while remaining an unprivileged user on the host.

Prerequisites:
Implementing rootless mode typically requires specific configurations on the host system, including:
Installation of newuidmap and newgidmap utilities (often part of the uidmap package).
Configuration of /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid to allocate a range of subordinate UIDs and GIDs for the non-root user.
Limitations:
While offering significant security benefits, rootless mode may have certain limitations compared to rootful mode, such as:
Inability to forward ports below 1024 (privileged ports) without specific configurations.
Potential compatibility issues with some legacy applications or tools that assume root privileges.
In essence, a Linux rootless user allows for the secure and isolated execution of containerized applications without granting them full root access to the host system, thereby improving overall system security.
