In Linux, /proc/self is a symbolic link within the /proc virtual filesystem. It always points to the /proc/<PID> directory corresponding to the process that is currently accessing it.
Key characteristics of /proc/self:

Dynamic Nature:
Unlike a typical symbolic link that points to a fixed location, /proc/self is dynamically resolved by the kernel at the time of access. This means that when a process opens or reads from /proc/self, the kernel automatically substitutes self with the process ID (PID) of the calling process.
Process Self-Inspection:
It allows a process to easily inspect its own status and information without needing to explicitly know its own PID. This simplifies code that needs to access process-specific data, such as memory maps (/proc/self/maps), open file descriptors (/proc/self/fd), or command-line arguments (/proc/self/cmdline).
Virtual Filesystem:
The /proc filesystem is a virtual filesystem, meaning its contents are not stored on a physical disk but are generated on-the-fly by the kernel to expose information about running processes and kernel parameters.
Example:
If a shell process with PID 1234 executes ls /proc/self, the kernel interprets this as ls /proc/1234. However, if the ls command itself is a separate process (which it typically is), then when ls accesses /proc/self, it will be resolved to ls /proc/<PID_of_ls>, showing information about the ls process itself, not the parent shell.
