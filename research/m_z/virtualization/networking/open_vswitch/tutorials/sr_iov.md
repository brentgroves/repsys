SR-IOV (Single Root I/O Virtualization) is a technology that allows a single physical PCI Express (PCIe) device to be shared among multiple virtual machines (VMs) while maintaining performance and security. It essentially enables a physical device, like a network adapter, to appear as multiple virtual devices to different VMs, reducing I/O virtualization overhead and improving performance.
