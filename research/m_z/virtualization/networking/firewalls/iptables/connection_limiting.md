# **[Connection Limiting](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/iptables-limit-connections)**

1. Introduction
As network administrators, we quite often find ourselves in situations where we need to control the number of connections to a particular server. This could be to prevent overload, ensure fair resource allocation, or protect against certain types of attacks, like denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

Fortunately, iptables, a powerful firewall utility for Linux, provides us with a solution for this. By using iptables, we can easily set rules to limit the maximum number of connections allowed to a server, effectively managing and controlling incoming traffic.

In this tutorial, we’ll dive into how to use iptables to accomplish this task. We’ll explore the various options and parameters available, as well as provide practical examples to demonstrate their usage.

2. Connlimit: an Iptables Module
In iptables, a module or extension is a small program that extends the functionality of the firewall. It provides additional features and options that can be used to customize the behavior of iptables. Using the -m or –match option, we can use various useful modules such as bpf, cgroup, conntrack, and others.

One such module is connlimit, which is used to limit the number of parallel connections that can be made to a specific server or port. It helps us by setting a maximum threshold for incoming connections, preventing a single source from overwhelming the server with too many connections. By using the connlimit module in iptables, we can effectively control and manage the incoming traffic to our server, ensuring that it doesn’t exceed a certain limit.
