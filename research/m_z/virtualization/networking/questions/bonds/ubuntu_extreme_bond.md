Hi

I have a 2 x Ubuntu systems that will be utilised as Frontend Load Balancers. I have configured the internal VRRP between the two servers with Keppalive D successfully. Now I need to configure the netplan yaml file with the Bond to 2 x Extreme switches. What is the best way to configure the LACP bond on the extreme switches please?

Yes, a single LAG from one device that goes to 2 EXOS switches is an MLAG topology.

You can find an MLAG config guide here:
