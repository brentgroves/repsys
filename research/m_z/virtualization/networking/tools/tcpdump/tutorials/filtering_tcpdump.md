- **[tcpdump options](https://upskilld.com/learn/using-tcpdump-options-filters-and-examples/)**

In my last article, Troubleshooting with tcpdump, I looked at the tcpdump tool, some basic use cases, and walked through a mock-up of a real-world scenario. Now, I want to dig a bit further. Everyone who uses this tool in a real situation immediately notices how much information (I believe they call this "verbose"...) is presented to the user. One of the best things you can do for yourself is figure out a practical way to filter for the information you need. Let's look at some ways that you can do this.

Common filtering options
The tcpdump tool has several different built-in ways to filter the capture itself. This means that you can narrow down the information that you receive before the capture even begins. This is highly preferable and makes post-capture filtering a much less tedious process. Some of the pre-capture filters you can use are as follows:

To filter by IP address:

`sudo tcpdump host x.x.x.x`

To filter by interface:

`sudo tcpdump -i eth0`

To filter by source:

`sudo tcpdump src x.x.x.x`

To filter by destination:

`sudo tcpdump dst x.x.x.x`

To filter by protocol:

`sudo tcpdump icmp`

This list does not cover each option available but gives you a good starting point. Next, let's look at some of the other ways that we can manipulate the capture.

## Writing captures to a file (pcap)

Due to the nature of troubleshooting, I find it useful to document what I see when capturing with tcpdump. Luckily, tcpdump has an output file format that captures all of the data we see. This format is called a packet capture file, aka PCAP, and is used across various utilities, including network analyzers and tcpdump. Here, we're writing to a PACAP file called output_file by using the -w switch.

```bash
# add -Z user parameter
# tcpdump -i eth0 -n -w out.pcap -C 1 -Z brent
[root@server ~]# tcpdump -i enp0s8 -c100 -nn -w output_file -Z brent
tcpdump: listening on enp0s8, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
100 packets captured
102 packets received by filter
0 packets dropped by kernel
```

## Reading pcap files

You can read PCAP files by using the -r switch. Just a heads upâ€”if you try to read a PCAP file via conventional means (cat, Vim, etc.), you will receive non-readable gibberish. If you want to use those programs to view your output, keep reading.

`tcpdump -r output_file`

## Writing tcpdump to .txt

If you want to use conventional means to read your output file, you need to rerun tcpdump, excluding the -w flag. You can see below that we use the standard output to file format with the file name output.txt.

```bash
[root@server ~]# tcpdump -i enp0s8 -c100 -nn > output.txt
  tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
  listening on enp0s8, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
  100 packets captured
  102 packets received by filter
  0 packets dropped by kernel
```

## Example

Before we go any further, I want to explain the scenario that I have set up for the rest of this article. We have three VMs running on the same network. Both Client 1 and Client 2 will ping the server nonstop. We will capture the ICMP traffic on interface enp0s8 on the Server VM and then filter for packets from each client machine. I realize this is a rather simple exercise, but the principles can be applied to more complex real-world environments.

- Server - 172.25.1.5
- Client 1 - 172.25.1.4
- Client 2 - 172.25.1.7

Next, we look at the two commands used to generate our captures:

Write to PCAP file - `tcpdump -i enp0s8 -c100 -nn -w output_file`
Write to TXT file - `tcpdump -i enp0s8 -c100 -nn > output.txt`

The only notable difference here is the output format. You see that we captured traffic on interface enp0s8 and that we limited the capture to 100 packets with no name or port resolution. Now, let's filter our file to just the traffic from Client 1.

To do this, we use one of two command strings (depending on the file format of our capture):

Filter PCAP output - `tcpdump -r output_file | grep -i 172.25.1.4`

```bash
[root@server ~]# tcpdump -r output_file | grep -i 172.25.1.4
reading from file output_file, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet)

To check for traffic to/from Client 2, we only need to change the IP address in the grep query. This method works for hostnames, port numbers, and any other keyword that you find in the capture file. This particular example shows the power of pre and post-filtering. Pre-filtering occurs when we only capture over a specific interface, and post-filtering happens when we apply a grep query to the capture file.

The takeaway
What I hope to communicate is that tcpdump is an incredibly powerful tool. Still, powerful technologies are often riddled with information that might not apply to your specific need. With some thought and planning, you can pre-filter your capture to narrow down the amount of traffic captured, and then use a smart grep or awk query on the output file to quickly find the traffic interactions that you are looking for. These strategies, when correctly applied, can exponentially quicken troubleshooting efforts. Now, here's to hoping that you don't have to put this to practice anytime soon.
