## Routing - Dynamic routing protocols

Dynamic routing protocols are protocols that operate on the **[control plane](https://notes.networklessons.com/network-control-plane)** that are used to share information about routes to particular network destinations. Typically used with IPv4 and IPv6 networks, these protocols operate on Layer 3 of the OSI model.
