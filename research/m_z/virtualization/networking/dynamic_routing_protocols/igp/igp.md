Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP) are **[dynamic routing protocols](https://notes.networklessons.com/routing-dynamic-routing-protocols)** that we (mostly) use on internal networks. IGPs are separated into two major types, based on the algorithms and methodology with which they learn about networks. These are link state and distance vector routing protocols.
