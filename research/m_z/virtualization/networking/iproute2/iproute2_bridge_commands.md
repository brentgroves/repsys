## An introduction to Linux bridging commands and features

A Linux bridge is a kernel module that behaves like a network switch, forwarding packets between interfaces that are connected to it. It's usually used for forwarding packets on routers, on gateways, or between VMs and network namespaces on a host.

The Linux bridge has included basic support for the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), multicast, and Netfilter since the 2.4 and 2.6 kernel series. Features that have been added in more recent releases include:

- Configuration via **[Netlink](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/netlink.7.html)**
- VLAN filter
- VxLAN tunnel mapping
- Internet Group Management Protocol version 3 (IGMPv3) and Multicast Listener Discovery version 2 (MLDv2)
- Switchdev

In this article, you'll get an introduction to these features and some useful commands to enable and control them. You'll also briefly examine **[Open vSwitch](https://www.openvswitch.org/)** as an alternative to Linux bridging.

## Basic bridge commands

All the commands used in this article are part of the iproute2 module, which invokes Netlink messages to configure the bridge. There are two iproute2 commands for setting and configuring bridges: ip link and bridge.

ip link can add and remove bridges and set their options. bridge displays and manipulates bridges on final distribution boards (FDBs), main distribution boards (MDBs), and virtual local area networks (VLANs).

**Final Distribution Boards:** A distribution board is a component of an electricity supply system which divides an electrical power feed into subsidiary circuits, ...

**MDB â€“ Main Distribution Boards:** MDB is a panel or enclosure that houses the fuses, circuit breakers and ground leakage protection units where the electrical energy is used to distribute ...

The listings that follow demonstrate some basic uses for the two commands. Both require administrator privileges, and therefore the listings are shown with the # root prompt instead of a regular user prompt.

Add interfaces to a bridge:

```bash
# ip link set veth0 master br0

# ip link set tap0 master br0
```

## Spanning Tree Protocol

The purpose of STP is to prevent a networking loop, which can lead to a traffic storm in the network. Figure 1 shows such a loop.

![](https://developers.redhat.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full_width_1440px_w/public/br_1.png?itok=J-oXObCl)

With STP enabled, the bridges will send each other Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs) so they can elect a root bridge and block an interface, making the network topology loop-free (Figure 2).

![](https://developers.redhat.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full_width_1440px_w/public/br_2.png?itok=ZJbkJjVE)

Linux bridging has supported STP since the 2.4 and 2.6 kernel series. To enable STP on a bridge, enter:

```bash
# ip link set br0 type bridge stp_state 1
```

Note: The Linux bridge does not support the Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP).

Now you can show the STP blocking state on the bridge:

```bash
# ip -j -p -d link show br0 | grep root_port

                "root_port": 1,

# ip -j -p -d link show br1 | grep root_port

                "root_port": 0,

# bridge link show

8: veth1@veth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 master br1 state forwarding priority 32 cost 2

```
