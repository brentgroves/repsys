# **[Task centered ip route2 (great resource)](https://baturin.org/docs/iproute2/)**

## Overview of iproute2

iproute2 is the Linux networking toolkit that replaced net-tools (ifconfig, vconfig, route, arp etc.). Most of the networking functionality is unified in the ip command. Thereâ€™s also tc for managing traffic policies (QoS), and ss (a netstat replacement), but this document is focused on the ip part.

iproute2 was originally written by Alex Kuznetsov and is now maintained by Stephen Hemminger.
