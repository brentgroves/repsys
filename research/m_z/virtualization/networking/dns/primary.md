What is a Primary or Master DNS Server?
A Primary DNS Server (also called a Master DNS Server) is the authoritative server for a specific domain. It holds the original DNS records and serves as the primary source of DNS information for that domain.

When other DNS servers or clients request these records, the Primary DNS Server provides them, and its responses are considered authoritative and final.
