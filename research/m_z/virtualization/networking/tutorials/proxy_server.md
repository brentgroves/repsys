A proxy server is an intermediary server that acts as a gateway between a user's computer and the internet, according to Fortinet. It intercepts network requests, processes them, and then forwards the data to the user, says Fortinet. Think of it as a go-between that hides your real IP address and can offer benefits like increased privacy, security, and potentially faster browsing speeds.
