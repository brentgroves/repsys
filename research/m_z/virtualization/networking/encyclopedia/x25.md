X.25 is a packet-switching protocol for **[wide area network (WAN)](https://networkencyclopedia.com/wide-area-network-wan/)** connectivity that uses a public data network (PDN) that parallels the voice network of the **[Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)](https://networkencyclopedia.com/public-switched-telephone-network-pstn/)**.

In communications, a PDN is a circuit- or packet-switched network that is available to the public and that can transmit data in digital form. A PDN provider is a company that provides access to a PDN and that provides any of X.25, Frame Relay, or cell relay (ATM) services.[1] Access to a PDN generally includes a guaranteed bandwidth, known as the committed information rate (CIR).

The current X.25 standard supports synchronous, full-duplex communication at speeds up to 2 Mbps over two pairs of wires, but most implementations are 64-Kbps connections via a **[standard DS0 link](https://networkencyclopedia.com/ds0/)**.

X.25 was developed by common carriers in the early 1970s and approved in 1976 by the CCITT, the precursor of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), and was designed as a global standard for a packet-switching network. X.25 was originally designed to connect remote character-based terminals to mainframe hosts. The original X.25 standard operated only at 19.2 Kbps, but this was generally sufficient for character-based communication between mainframes and terminals.
