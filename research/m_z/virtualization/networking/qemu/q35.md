A chipset is a set of integrated circuits on a motherboard that manages data flow between a computer's components. It's often called the "glue" of the motherboard because it controls how all the components communicate with each other. 

The Intel Q35 chipset is primarily used for embedded computing applications, offering features like low power consumption, strong data protection, manageability, and security, making it suitable for devices like point-of-sale terminals, industrial control systems, and interactive PCs, where reliability and stability are crucial; it is designed to work with Intel Core processors and provides quality graphics capabilities while maintaining a low power profile. 

QemuQ35Pkg...

Is a derivative of OvmfPkg.
Will not support Legacy BIOS or CSM.
WIll not support S3 sleep functionality.
Has a 32-bit PEI phase and a 64-bit DXE phase.
Seeks to enable a tightly constrained virtual platform based on the QEMU Q35 machine type.
By solely focusing on the Q35 chipset, this package can be optimized such that it is allowed to break compatibility with other QEMU supported chipsets. The Q35 chipset can be paired with an IA32 or X64 processor to enable a machine that can emulate PC class hardware with industry standard features like SMM and PCI-E.
