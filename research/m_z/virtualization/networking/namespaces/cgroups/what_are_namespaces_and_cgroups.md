## AI Overview

Is a container a process?

### Containers as Processes

Containers run as regular processes on the host operating system's kernel, meaning they share the same kernel as the host.

### Isolation

Containers are designed to isolate processes from each other and from the host system, using mechanisms like namespaces and cgroups.

### Resource Management

Containers can be configured to have specific resource limits (CPU, memory, etc.), ensuring that one container doesn't consume resources that others need.

### Lightweight

Containers are much lighter than virtual machines (VMs) because they don't require a full guest operating system, making them faster to start and use.

### Portability and Reproducibility

Containers help create portable and reproducible environments for applications, as they package the application and its dependencies into a single unit.

### Docker Containers

Docker containers are a common example of containers, where a container is a running instance of a docker image.

### Example

When you run a Docker container, it starts a process (or a set of processes) that are isolated and managed by the container runtime.

## What is a process?

A process represents a running program; it is an instance of an executing program. A process consists of memory and a set of data structures. The kernel uses these data structures to store important information about the state of the program.
