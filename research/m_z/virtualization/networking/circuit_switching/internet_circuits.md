# **[Internet circuits: What they are + when to get new ones](https://www.meter.com/resources/internet-circuit)**

You can’t run a modern business without a reliable internet circuit, often delivered as dedicated ethernet. It's how your traffic gets in and out of the building. For IT teams, it's one of the most important things to get right, and one of the easiest things to outgrow.

## What is an internet circuit?

An internet circuit is a dedicated service that connects your building to the internet with fixed bandwidth and provider-managed performance. Unlike home internet, it’s designed for business needs, with defined speed, uptime, and support expectations.

How it differs from generic “internet access”
An internet circuit is how your building connects to the wider internet. It’s a fixed, provisioned service that includes a handoff point from the ISP and often comes with a service-level agreement (SLA).

A circuit isn’t the same as having typical internet access. Instead, an internet circuit is like an exclusive pipeline just for your business, often complete with business-grade features like dedicated bandwidth and support.

## How does a dedicated internet circuit differ from shared broadband?

Dedicated internet circuits, like DIA, offer fixed, symmetrical bandwidth that only your business can use. Shared broadband, like cable or DSL, splits bandwidth across many users. That’s why performance drops during busy hours.

A DIA circuit also usually comes with guaranteed uptime, faster repair times, and business-grade routing.

"DIA circuits" typically refers to Dedicated Internet Access (DIA) circuits, which provide a business with a private, high-speed, and reliable connection to the internet, unlike shared residential broadband. DIA circuits are essential for businesses with critical internet-dependent operations, offering features like symmetrical bandwidth, guaranteed uptime via Service Level Agreements (SLAs), low latency, and enhanced security. They are physically installed by the Internet Service Provider (ISP) and can be constructed using various technologies, with fiber optic cables (Ethernet over Fiber or EoF) being a popular and scalable choice for high-capacity needs.

## Where does a DIA fit into your network infrastructure?

The internet circuit links your internal network to the outside world. It’s what connects your office or data center to cloud apps, customers, and remote teams. It's not just a wire. It's a contract, a performance guarantee, and often the first point of failure during an outage.

## Circuit vs. connection: Why it matters for businesses

A “connection” can be any way to access the internet. A “circuit” implies provisioning, service guarantees, and performance expectations. Businesses that treat their circuit like just a basic connection often run into limits when they scale.

Let’s look at the differences in the features of a basic internet connection vs. an internet circuit:

| Feature              | An internet connection             | An internet circuit                                 |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Definition           | General access to the internet     | Provisioned, dedicated pathway to the internet      |
| Ownership            | Typically shared with other users  | Assigned specifically to your business              |
| Bandwidth Guarantees | Best-effort, no guarantees         | Fixed and guaranteed (especially with DIA)          |
| Performance          | Varies based on network congestion | Consistent, predictable performance                 |
| Support Level        | Limited or consumer-grade support  | Business-grade support with SLAs                    |
| Scalability          | Hard to scale reliably             | Scales with business needs                          |
| Use Case             | Casual or small office use         | Business operations, cloud services, real-time apps |
