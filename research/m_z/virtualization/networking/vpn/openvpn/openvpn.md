## does openvpn use gre

No, OpenVPN does not use GRE by default; OpenVPN is a VPN protocol that encapsulates and encrypts data, while GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) is a separate tunneling protocol that encapsulates network packets without providing encryption by itself. However, it is possible to run GRE tunnels over an existing OpenVPN tunnel to add Layer 2 bridging or routing capabilities that OpenVPN alone cannot provide.

## OpenVPN vs. GRE

OpenVPN is a complete VPN solution that establishes a secure, encrypted tunnel between endpoints, providing both privacy and network connectivity.
GRE is a much simpler tunneling protocol that primarily serves to encapsulate different network protocols (like IP, IPv4, or IPv6) within another IP packet, effectively creating a point-to-point link between two routers.
Lack of Encryption in GRE A key distinction is that GRE tunnels, by default, do not encrypt the encapsulated traffic. To secure GRE traffic, you typically need to run GRE over a more secure protocol, such as IPsec, or in this specific context, use OpenVPN as the underlying secure tunnel.

Why Run GRE Over OpenVPN?
In some advanced network scenarios, such as creating Layer 2 bridges or enabling dynamic routing protocols over a VPN, users may implement GRE tunnels on top of an existing OpenVPN connection. This is because standard OpenVPN, in certain configurations, does not directly support these advanced network features.
