In this article, we are going to cover one of the most commonly asked DSA topic which is the Spanning Tree with its definition, properties, and applications. Moreover, we will explore the Minimum Spanning Tree and various algorithms used to construct it. These algorithms have various pros and cons over each other depending on the use case of the problem.

## What is a Spanning Tree?

A spanning tree is a subset of Graph G, such that all the vertices are connected using minimum possible number of edges. Hence, a spanning tree does not have cycles and a graph may have more than one spanning tree.
