## IPv6 Address Types

IPv6 looks different than IPv4 but there are some similarities. For example we have unicast addresses and we still have a “public” and “private” range. We use different names for these but the idea is the same. One of the differences is that IPv6 has some additional unicast address types.

We still have multicast, same idea but we use different addresses. There are also some reserved addresses that are similar to their IPv4 counterparts.

Something new is anycast, an address that can be assigned on multiple devices so that packets are always routed to the closest destination. Also, broadcast traffic doesn’t exist in IPv6 anymore.

In this lesson we’ll take a look at all the different address types and I’ll explain what they look like and how we use them.
