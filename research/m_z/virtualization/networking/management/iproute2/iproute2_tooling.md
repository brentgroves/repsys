## How To Use IPRoute2 Tools to Manage Network Configuration on a Linux VPS

A virtual private server is a virtual machine sold as a service by an Internet hosting service. The term "virtual dedicated server" also has a similar meaning.

## Introduction

It is essential to have an understanding of basic networking tools when administering and troubleshooting Linux servers. While some tools are made primarily for monitoring, other low-level utilities are used to configure the network connection itself and implement default settings.

Traditionally, a group of unrelated tools lumped together under the title of net-tools was used to do this. They were often packaged together to provide full functionality coverage, but their development and usage strategy varied from tool to tool.

Because of inconsistencies, as well as halted maintenance, a collection of tools known under the umbrella moniker iproute2 has been used to replace these separate tools. They have been developed in tandem to share syntax and operate together efficiently.

In this guide, we will discuss how to use the iproute2 tools to configure, manipulate, and gather information about your network. We will be using an Ubuntu 12.04 VPS to demonstrate, but most modern Linux distributions should provide the same level of functionality.

While the querying commands can usually be executed as an unprivileged user, root privileges must be used to modify settings.

## How To View Network Interfaces, Addresses, and Routes

One of the most fundamental responsibilities of the iproute2 suite is to manage actual interfaces.

Usually, the interfaces themselves will be named things like eth0, eth1, lo, etc. Traditionally, the ifconfig command was used to configure items in this area. Under the iproute2 system, the subcommands ip addr and ip link take care of these steps.

With ifconfig, you could gather information about the current state of your network interfaces by typing the command with no arguments:

```bash
ifconfig
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 54:be:f7:08:c2:1b  
          inet addr:192.168.56.126  Bcast:192.168.56.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          inet6 addr: fe80::56be:f7ff:fe08:c21b/64 Scope:Link
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:114273 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:58866 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 
          RX bytes:73490903 (73.4 MB)  TX bytes:14294252 (14.2 MB)
          Interrupt:20 Memory:f7f00000-f7f20000 

lo        Link encap:Local Loopback  
          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host
          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1
          RX packets:3942 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:3942 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 
          RX bytes:668121 (668.1 KB)  TX bytes:668121 (668.1 KB)
```

## To get information about a single interface, you can always specify it as an argument

```bash
ifconfig eth0 

Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr 54:be:f7:08:c2:1b
inet addr:192.168.56.126 Bcast:192.168.56.255 Mask:255.255.255.0 inet6 addr: fe80::56be:f7ff:fe08:c21b/64 Scope:Link UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST MTU:1500 Metric:1 RX packets:114829 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0 TX packets:59007 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0 collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 RX bytes:73598364 (73.5 MB) TX bytes:14325245 (14.3 MB) Interrupt:20 Memory:f7f00000-f7f20000 </pre>
```

We can replicate this functionality with subcommands in the iproute2 suite.

To get an overview of the addresses attached to each interface, type ip addr in with no arguments:

```bash
ip addr
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: enp0s25: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 18:03:73:1f:84:a4 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.1.0.113/22 brd 10.1.3.255 scope global noprefixroute enp0s25
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::4fa4:f4f6:dc79:6f02/64 scope link noprefixroute 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
3: br-860dc0d9b54b: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN group default 
    link/ether 02:42:c3:91:40:d5 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.18.0.1/16 brd 172.18.255.255 scope global br-860dc0d9b54b
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
4: br-924b3db7b366: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN group default 
    link/ether 02:42:80:1a:94:fa brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.21.0.1/16 brd 172.21.255.255 scope global br-924b3db7b366
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
5: br-b543cc541f49: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN group default 
    link/ether 02:42:dd:fd:bf:e8 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.19.0.1/16 brd 172.19.255.255 scope global br-b543cc541f49
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
6: docker0: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN group default 
    link/ether 02:42:eb:fe:4b:de brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.17.0.1/16 brd 172.17.255.255 scope global docker0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
7: br-ef440bd353e1: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN group default 
    link/ether 02:42:19:21:c9:c6 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.23.0.1/16 brd 172.23.255.255 scope global br-ef440bd353e1
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

```

To get a specific interface, you can use this syntax:

```bash
ip addr show docker0

6: docker0: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN group default 
    link/ether 02:42:eb:fe:4b:de brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.17.0.1/16 brd 172.17.255.255 scope global docker0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

ip addr show enp0s25

2: enp0s25: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 18:03:73:1f:84:a4 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.1.0.113/22 brd 10.1.3.255 scope global noprefixroute enp0s25
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::4fa4:f4f6:dc79:6f02/64 scope link noprefixroute 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
       
```

If you are only concerned with the interfaces themselves and not the addresses, you can use the ip link command instead:

```bash
ip link
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: enp0s25: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 18:03:73:1f:84:a4 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
3: br-860dc0d9b54b: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default 
    link/ether 02:42:c3:91:40:d5 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
4: br-924b3db7b366: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default 
    link/ether 02:42:80:1a:94:fa brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
5: br-b543cc541f49: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default 
    link/ether 02:42:dd:fd:bf:e8 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
6: docker0: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default 
    link/ether 02:42:eb:fe:4b:de brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
7: br-ef440bd353e1: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default 
    link/ether 02:42:19:21:c9:c6 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```

In fact, the ip addr command is just an alias for the ip addr show command.

To get information about a specific interface, youâ€™ll need to add the keyword show followed by the interface name:

```bash
ip link show docker0
6: docker0: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default 
    link/ether 02:42:eb:fe:4b:de brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```

To get statistics about how an interface is communicating, you can query statistics from each interface by passing the -s option to the link subcommand:

```bash
ip -s link show enp0s25
2: enp0s25: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 18:03:73:1f:84:a4 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    RX:  bytes packets errors dropped  missed   mcast           
     877007913 3132044      0       0       0  458753 
    TX:  bytes packets errors dropped carrier collsns           
      17715685  112987      0       0       0       0 
```

So how do we find our routing table? The routing table contains kernel information about the paths to other network locations. We can print off the current routing table by typing:

```bash
# example network
ip route show
default via 107.170.58.1 dev eth0  metric 100
107.170.58.0/24 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope link  src 107.170.58.162 
```

This shows us that the default route to the greater internet is available through the eth0 interface and the address 107.170.58.1. We can access this server through that interface, where our own interface address is 107.170.58.162.

```bash

ip route show
default via 10.1.1.205 dev enp0s25 proto static metric 100 
10.1.0.0/22 dev enp0s25 proto kernel scope link src 10.1.0.113 metric 100 
169.254.0.0/16 dev enp0s25 scope link metric 1000 
172.17.0.0/16 dev docker0 proto kernel scope link src 172.17.0.1 linkdown 
172.18.0.0/16 dev br-860dc0d9b54b proto kernel scope link src 172.18.0.1 linkdown 
172.19.0.0/16 dev br-b543cc541f49 proto kernel scope link src 172.19.0.1 linkdown 
172.21.0.0/16 dev br-924b3db7b366 proto kernel scope link src 172.21.0.1 linkdown 
172.23.0.0/16 dev br-ef440bd353e1 proto kernel scope link src 172.23.0.1 linkdown 


```

This shows us that the default route to the greater internet is available through the enp0s25 interface and the address 10.1.1.205. We can access this server through that interface, where our own interface address is 10.1.0.113.

## How To Configure Network Interfaces and Addresses

Now that you are familiar with how to get information about the interfaces and addresses associated with them, the next step is to find out how to modify their states.

The first step is to configure the interface itself. You can do this with the ip link subcommand again. This time, however, you pass the action set instead of show in order to modify values.

For instance, we can bring a network interface up or down by issuing these:

```bash
ip link set eth1 up 
ip link set eth1 down

```

Note: Be careful not to accidentally bring down the interface that you are connected to your server through.

You can also use the ip link subcommand to set attributes about the interface. For instance, if you would like to change the multicast flag on or off for your interface, you can type:

```bash
ip link set eth1 multicast on 
ip link set eth1 multicast off
```

You can adjust the mtu and package queue length like this:

```bash
ip link set eth1 mtu 1500 
ip link set eth1 txqueuelen 1000 

```

If the interface you are configuring is down, you can adjust the interface name and the arp flag associated with the device:

```bash
ip link set eth1 name eth10 
ip link set eth1 arp on 

```

To adjust the addresses associated with the interfaces, we again use the ip addr subcommand.

We can add an address to a device by typing:

```bash
ip addr add ip_address/net_prefix brd + dev interface
```

The brd + portion of the command automatically sets the broadcast address. Multiple addresses can be added to each interface without a problem.

We can get rid of addresses with the inverse operation. To delete a specific address associated with an interface, you can use it like this:

```bash
ip addr del ip_address/net_prefix dev interface
```

Optionally, you can omit the address, and the first listed address associated with that interface will be deleted.

You can also adjust the routing of the server, using the ip route [add | change | replace | delete ] syntax, but we wonâ€™t be covering this here, because most people will will not be adjusting this on a regular basis.

## Additional Capabilities of IPRoute2

IPRoute2 has some additional capabilities that we will not be able to discuss in-depth in this guide. Instead, we will talk about what these are and what situations you may find them useful.

The idea of IP routing rules is difficult to talk about because it is very situation dependent. Basically, you can decide on how to route traffic based on a number of fields, including target address, source address, routing protocol, packet size, etc.

We access this functionality by using the ip rule subcommand. The basic querying follows the general pattern of the other subcommands:

```bash
ip rule show

0:      from all lookup local
32766:  from all lookup main
32767:  from all lookup default
```

These three routing rules are the default rules configured by the kernel. The first line matches any traffic and is used to route high priority traffic. The second line is the main rule that handles normal routing. The last one is an empty rule that is used for post-processing if the rules above didnâ€™t match the packet.

Routing rules, as configured by the IPRoute2 software, are stored in a routing policy database, where the policy is selected by matching against sets of rules. We can add or delete rules using the appropriate actions. You should not do this without knowing what you are doing however. Look at the man pages and search for ip rule for more information.

```bash
man ip         # search for "ip rule"
```

Another thing that weâ€™ll discuss briefly is the handling of arp information through these tools. The subcommand that deals with this information is called ip neigh.

```bash
ip neigh
10.1.1.205 dev enp0s25 lladdr 34:56:fe:77:58:bc REACHABLE
10.1.0.30 dev enp0s25 lladdr d4:ad:71:bc:e7:c0 STALE
```

By default, this should at least list your gateway. Arp is a protocol used to gather information about physical devices accessible through the local network.

Basically, an arp request is broadcast over the local network whenever an IP address needs to be reached. The matching IP address responds and then the local computer knows where to send information to that IP address. This information is cached on the local system for some time (typically about 15 minutes) to avoid having to query during follow up communication.

## Conclusion

You should now have a fairly good idea of how to use the tools included in the iproute2 suite. While many guides and tutorials still refer to the old utilities, partly because knowledgeable system admins often grew up using the older tools, the commands discussed in this guide will be taking over in the coming years.

It is important to familiarize yourself with these commands now before you find yourself troubleshooting issues on a system that has switched to these commands (Arch Linux already fully converted in 2011). In general, they are much more consistent, and you can count on certain conventions being available in all of the commands. The more you use these commands, the more they will become second nature.
