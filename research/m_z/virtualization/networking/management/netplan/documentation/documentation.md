Netplan is a network configuration abstraction renderer.

It is a utility for network configuration on a Linux system. You create a description of the required interfaces and define what each should do.

Netplan meets the need of easy, descriptive network configuration in YAML across a versatile set of server, desktop, cloud or IoT installations.

It is useful for administrators of a Linux system who want to use a common network configuration, controlling different back ends like NetworkManager or systemd-networkd.
