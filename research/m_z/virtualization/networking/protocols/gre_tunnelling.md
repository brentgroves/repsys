Generic Routing Encapsulation, or GRE, is a protocol for wrapping data packets inside secondary data packets in order to set up a direct point-to-point network connection.

What is GRE?
Generic Routing Encapsulation, or GRE, is a protocol for encapsulating data packets that use one routing protocol inside the packets of another protocol. "Encapsulating" means wrapping one data packet within another data packet, like putting a box inside another box. GRE is one way to set up a direct point-to-point connection across a network, for the purpose of simplifying connections between separate networks. It works with a variety of network layer protocols.
