# spanning tree

A "spanning tree" can refer to a subgraph in graph theory that connects all vertices without cycles, or a network protocol called the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) which prevents network loops by disabling redundant paths on switches. In graph theory, a spanning tree includes every vertex of the original graph. In networking, STP ensures a single active path between devices by blocking redundant links, preventing broadcast storms and MAC table instability caused by loops.

## Spanning Tree in Graph Theory

- **Definition:** A spanning tree is a subgraph of a larger graph that includes all the vertices of the original graph but contains no cycles.
- **Properties:** A spanning tree of a graph with \(n\) vertices will have exactly \(n-1\) edges
- **Applications:** This mathematical concept is used in various applications, including network design and optimization problems.
