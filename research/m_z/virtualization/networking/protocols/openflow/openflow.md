OpenFlow, an open source standard supported by many vendors, is the first software defined networking (SDN) control protocol. It separates the control plane (decision-making) from the forwarding plane (packet routing).

OpenFlow is currently in version 1.5 of the specification. It is maintained by the Open Network Foundation.

OpenFlow is a **[network control protocol](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/protocol)**. Network traffic does not go through the OpenFlow protocol. Instead, OpenFlow sends the control signals that tell the network switches how to route the network traffic.

In traditional network design, each switch would contain a routing table that it used to decide how to route each packet. This routing table is largely static; it would be updated by the administrator individually on each router.
