Once data is routed through the network and delivered to a specific host, it must be delivered to the correct user or process. As the data moves up or down the TCP/IP layers, a mechanism is needed to deliver it to the correct protocols in each layer. The system must be able to combine data from many applications into a few transport protocols, and from the transport protocols into the Internet Protocol. Combining many sources of data into a single data stream is called multiplexing.

Data arriving from the network must be demultiplexed: divided for delivery to multiple processes. To accomplish this task, IP uses protocol numbers to identify transport protocols, and the transport protocols use port numbers to identify applications.

Some protocol and port numbers are reserved to identify well-known services. Well-known services are standard network protocols, such as FTP and telnet, that are commonly used throughout the network. The protocol numbers and port numbers allocated to well-known services are documented in the Assigned Numbers RFC. UNIX systems define protocol and port numbers in two simple text files.

## 2.7.1 Protocol Numbers

The protocol number is a single byte in the third word of the datagram header. The value identifies the protocol in the layer above IP to which the data should be passed.

On a UNIX system, the protocol numbers are defined in /etc/protocols. This file is a simple table containing the protocol name and the protocol number associated with that name. The format of the table is a single entry per line, consisting of the official protocol name, separated by whitespace from the protocol number. The protocol number is separated by whitespace from the "alias" for the protocol name. Comments in the table begin with #. An /etc/protocols file is shown below:

```bash
% cat /etc/protocols
# ident  "@(#)protocols  1.2     90/02/03 SMI"   /*SVr4.0 1.1*/
# Internet (IP) protocols
ip      0       IP      # internet protocol, pseudo protocol number
icmp    1       ICMP    # internet control message protocol
ggp     3       GGP     # gateway-gateway protocol
tcp     6       TCP     # transmission control protocol
egp     8       EGP     # exterior gateway protocol
pup     12      PUP     # PARC universal packet protocol
udp     17      UDP     # user datagram protocol
hmp     20      HMP     # host monitoring protocol
xns-idp 22      XNS-IDP # Xerox NS IDP
rdp     27      RDP     # "reliable datagram" protocol
```

The listing shown above is the contents of the /etc/protocols file from a Solaris 2.5.1 workstation. This list of numbers is by no means complete. If you refer to the Protocol Numbers section of the Assigned Numbers RFC, you'll see many more protocol numbers. However, a system needs to include only the numbers of the protocols that it actually uses. Even the list shown above is more than this specific workstation needed, but the additional entries do no harm.

What exactly does this table mean? When a datagram arrives and its destination address matches the local IP address, the IP layer knows that the datagram has to be delivered to one of the transport protocols above it. To decide which protocol should receive the datagram, IP looks at the datagram's protocol number. Using this table you can see that, if the datagram's protocol number is 6, IP delivers the datagram to TCP. If the protocol number is 17, IP delivers the datagram to UDP. TCP and UDP are the two transport layer services we are concerned with, but all of the protocols listed in the table use IP datagram delivery service directly. Some, such as ICMP, EGP, and GGP, have already been mentioned. You don't need to be concerned with the minor protocols.

## 2.7.2 Port Numbers

After IP passes incoming data to the transport protocol, the transport protocol passes the data to the correct application process. Application processes (also called network services) are identified by port numbers, which are 16-bit values. The source port number, which identifies the process that sent the data, and the destination port number, which identifies the process that is to receive the data, are contained in the first header word of each TCP segment and UDP packet.

On UNIX systems, port numbers are defined in the /etc/services file. There are many more network applications than there are transport layer protocols, as the size of the table shows. Port numbers below 256 are reserved for well-known services (like FTP and telnet) and are defined in the Assigned Numbers RFC. Ports numbered from 256 to 1024 are used for UNIX-specific services, services like rlogin that were originally developed for UNIX systems. However, most of them are no longer UNIX-specific.

Port numbers are not unique between transport layer protocols; the numbers are only unique within a specific transport protocol. In other words, TCP and UDP can, and do, both assign the same port numbers. It is the combination of protocol and port numbers that uniquely identifies the specific process to which the data should be delivered.

A partial /etc/services file from a Solaris 2.5.1 workstation is shown below. The format of this file is very similar to the /etc/protocols file. Each single-line entry starts with the official name of the service, separated by whitespace from the port number/protocol pairing associated with that service. The port numbers are paired with transport protocol names, because different transport protocols may use the same port number. An optional list of aliases for the official service name may be provided after the port number/protocol pair.

This table, combined with the /etc/protocols table, provides all of the information necessary to deliver data to the correct application. A datagram arrives at its destination based on the destination address in the fifth word of the datagram header. Using the protocol number in the third word of the datagram header, IP delivers the data from the datagram to the proper transport layer protocol. The first word of the data delivered to the transport protocol contains the destination port number that tells the transport protocol to pass the data up to a specific application. Figure 2.6 shows this delivery process.
