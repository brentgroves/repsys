A TPM key storage refers to the secure storage of cryptographic keys within a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). TPMs are specialized security hardware designed to safeguard sensitive information, including encryption keys. These keys are used for various security functions like encrypting and decrypting data, authenticating users, and securing the boot process.
Here's a more detailed explanation:
Secure Hardware:
A TPM is a dedicated chip on a computer's motherboard (or embedded within a processor) that provides a secure environment for cryptographic operations.
Key Storage:
The TPM stores cryptographic keys, which are used for encryption, decryption, and authentication.
Restricted Access:
Access to the keys stored in the TPM is strictly controlled. You can't directly read the private keys from the TPM, ensuring their security even if the host system is compromised.
Key Protection:
Keys can be encrypted (wrapped or bound) by the TPM, making them unreadable outside the TPM environment.
Examples:
TPMs are used for full disk encryption (like BitLocker), secure boot processes, and protecting digital certificates.
Attestation:
TPMs can be used to attest to the integrity of the system, proving that the device is in a trusted state and hasn't been tampered with, according to TechTarget.
Key Types:
TPMs can store different types of keys, including endorsement keys (unique to the TPM), storage root keys (used to protect other keys), and attestation identity keys (used for proving identity).
