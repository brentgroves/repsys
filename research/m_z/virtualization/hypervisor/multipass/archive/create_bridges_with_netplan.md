# **[How to Bridge Two Network Interfaces in Linux Using Netplan](https://www.tecmint.com/netplan-bridge-network-interfaces/)**

## netplan

Netplan is a utility for easily configuring networking on a Linux system, typically used in Ubuntu. It allows users to configure network interfaces through a simple YAML file.

One common use case is creating a network bridge, which is useful for connecting two or more network interfaces to share a network segment, which is particularly useful in virtualized environments.

## Why Bridging Interfaces is Useful

Bridging network interfaces can be highly beneficial in various scenarios:

- When running virtual machines (VMs), you often need the VMs to communicate with the external network. A bridge allows VMs to appear as if they are physically connected to the same network as the host machine.
- It allows multiple network interfaces to share a single IP subnet, facilitating easier management and communication within the network.
- In complex network setups, bridges can simplify configurations and reduce the need for additional routing.

## Installing bridge-utils in Ubuntu

To bridge network interfaces, you need to install a bridge-utils package which is used to configure and manage network bridges in Linux-based systems.

```bash
sudo apt install bridge-utils
```

## Creating a Network Bridge Using Static IP

Similar to the DHCP configuration, you can also configure static IP addresses on the bridge in the same configuration file.

```bash
# create backup
cd ~
sudo cp /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml .
sudo vi /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
```

## Configure network with netplan and a bridge

This is the config file for our r620s which our connected to a trunk port with 2 vlan configured, vlan 50 being the default tag when no packet tag info is present.

```yaml
# This file is generated from information provided by the datasource.  Changes
# to it will not persist across an instance reboot.  To disable cloud-init's
# network configuration capabilities, write a file
# /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg with the following:
# network: {config: disabled
network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    eno1:
      dhcp4: false
      dhcp6: false
  vlans:
    vlan220:
      id: 220
      link: eno1
  bridges:
    br0:
      dhcp4: false
      dhcp6: false  
      addresses:
      - 10.188.50.202/24    
      routes:
      - to: default
        via: 10.188.50.254
      nameservers:
        addresses:
        - 10.225.50.203
        - 10.224.50.203
      interfaces: [eno1] 
    br1:
      interfaces: ["vlan220"]
      dhcp4: false
      dhcp6: false  
      addresses:
      - 10.188.220.202/24
      nameservers:
        addresses:
        - 10.225.50.203
        - 10.224.50.203
      routes:
        - to: 10.188.73.0/24
          via: 10.188.220.254      
```

Apply the Configuration Changes: Once youâ€™ve edited the configuration file, apply the changes to update your network settings.

```bash
sudo netplan try
$ sudo netplan apply
reboot
```

## Verify routing tables

**[references iproute2 intro for ip commands](../networking/iproute2/introduction_to_iproute.md)**

```bash
ip route list table local
