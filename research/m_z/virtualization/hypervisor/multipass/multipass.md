## **[What is Multipass](https://github.com/canonical/multipass)**

Multipass is a lightweight VM manager for Linux, Windows and macOS. It's designed for developers who want a fresh Ubuntu environment with a single command. It uses KVM on Linux, Hyper-V on Windows and QEMU on macOS to run the VM with minimal overhead. It can also use VirtualBox on Windows and macOS. Multipass will fetch images for you and keep them up to date.

Since it supports metadata for cloud-init, you can simulate a small cloud deployment on your laptop or workstation.

## Multipass Documentation

Multipass is a tool to generate cloud-style Ubuntu VMs quickly on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

It gives you a simple but powerful CLI that allows you to quickly access an Ubuntu command line or create your own local mini-cloud.

Local development and testing is a pain, but Multipass makes it easier by automating all of your setup and teardown. Multipass has a growing library of images that give you the ability to launch purpose-built VMs, or custom VMs you‚Äôve configured yourself through its powerful cloud-init interface.

Developers can use Multipass to prototype cloud deployments and to create fresh, customized Linux dev environments on any machine. Mac and Windows users can use Multipass as the quickest way to get an Ubuntu command line on their system. New Ubuntu users can use it as a sandbox to try new things without affecting their host machine, and without the need to dual boot.

## To uninstall Multipass, simply run

```sudo snap remove multipass```

## **[Install Multipass](https://multipass.run/docs/installing-on-linux#heading--install-upgrade-uninstall)**

To install Multipass, simply execute:

```bash
$ snap install multipass
multipass 1.13.0 from Canonical‚úì installed
```

For architectures other than amd64, you‚Äôll need the beta channel at the moment.

You can also use the edge channel to get the latest development build:

```bash
snap install multipass --edge
```

Make sure you‚Äôre part of the group that Multipass gives write access to its **[socket](../sockets/unix_domain_sockets.md)** (sudo in this case, but it may also be adm or admin, depending on your distribution):

Make sure you‚Äôre part of the group that Multipass gives write access to its socket (sudo in this case, but it may also be adm or admin, depending on your distribution):

```bash
$ ls -l /var/snap/multipass/common/multipass_socket
srw-rw---- 1 root sudo 0 Dec 19 09:47 /var/snap/multipass/common/multipass_socket
$ groups | grep sudo
brent adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin lxd sambashare docker

```

## **[Step 0: Change to LXD driver](https://jon.sprig.gs/blog/post/2800)**

Currently only the LXD driver supports the networks command on Linux.

So, let‚Äôs make multipass on Ubuntu use LXD! (Be prepared for entering your password a few times!)

```bash
multipass networks

networks failed: The networks feature is not implemented on this backend.
```

## Firstly, we need to install LXD. Dead simple

LXD ( [l…õks'di:] üîà) is a modern, secure and powerful system container and virtual machine manager. It provides a unified experience for running and managing full Linux systems inside containers or virtual machines.

```bash
sudo snap install lxd
lxd (5.21/stable) 5.21.1-d46c406 from Canonical‚úì installed
```

Next, we need to tell snap that it‚Äôs allowed to connect LXD to multipass:

```bash
sudo snap connect multipass:lxd lxd
sudo snap connections multipass
Interface          Plug                         Slot                Notes

x11                multipass:x11                :x11                -```

And lastly, we tell multipass to use lxd:

```bash
multipass set local.driver=lxd
multipass networks

Name        Type       Description

```

## create a bridge optional

**[50-cloud-init](https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2492108)**

## Brent's summary

I updated /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml at it's changes persisted on reboot but if I start having network problems this is the first place I will check. I also only tested this on ubuntu 24.04.

## Installing bridge-utils in Ubuntu

To bridge network interfaces, you need to install a bridge-utils package which is used to configure and manage network bridges in Linux-based systems.

```bash
sudo apt install bridge-utils
```

## Creating a Network Bridge Using Static IP

Similar to the DHCP configuration, you can also configure static IP addresses on the bridge in the same configuration file.

```bash
# create backup
cd ~
sudo cp /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml .
sudo vi /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
```

## Modify the configuration to assign a static IP to the bridge ‚Äòbr0‚Äò

I did not include renderer: networkd when I updated 50-cloud-init.yaml.

```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    enp1s0:
      dhcp4: no
    enp2s0f1:
      dhcp4: no
  bridges:
    br0:
      dhcp4: no
      addresses: [192.168.122.100/24]
      routes:
        - to: 0.0.0.0/0
          via: 192.168.122.1  # Adjust according to your network configuration
      nameservers:
        addresses: [8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4]  # DNS servers
      interfaces: [enp1s0, enp2s0f1]
```

The actual 50-cloud-init.yaml looked like this.

```yaml
# This file is generated from information provided by the datasource.  Changes
# to it will not persist across an instance reboot.  To disable cloud-init's
# network configuration capabilities, write a file
# /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg with the following:
# network: {config: disabled}
network:
    ethernets:
        eno1:
            addresses:
            - 10.1.0.125/22
            nameservers:
                addresses:
                - 10.1.2.69
                - 10.1.2.70
                - 172.20.0.39
                search: [BUSCHE-CNC.COM]
            routes:
            -   to: default
                via: 10.1.1.205
        eno2:
            dhcp4: no
        eno3:
            dhcp4: true
        eno4:
            dhcp4: true
        enp66s0f0:
            dhcp4: true
        enp66s0f1:
            dhcp4: true
        enp66s0f2:
            dhcp4: true
        enp66s0f3:
            dhcp4: true
    bridges:
        br0:
            dhcp4: no
            addresses:
            - 10.1.0.126/22
            nameservers:
                addresses:
                - 10.1.2.69
                - 10.1.2.70
                - 172.20.0.39
                search: [BUSCHE-CNC.COM]
            interfaces: [eno2]
        br1:
            dhcp4: no
            addresses:
            - 10.13.31.1/24
    version: 2
```

Next we launch an instance with an extra network, connecting it to this bridge:

```bash
multipass launch --name test1 --network name=br0
multipass exec -n test1 -- sudo networkctl -a status
...

## Create an instance

<https://multipass.run/docs/create-an-instance#heading--create-an-instance>

To create an instance with Multipass, execute:

```bash
$ multipass launch

## To launch an instance with a specific image

To launch an instance with a specific image, pass the image name or alias to multipass launch:

```bash
$ multipass launch kinetic
Launched: tenacious-mink
multipass info confirms that we‚Äôve launched an instance of the selected image.

$ multipass info tenacious-mink
Name:           tenacious-mink
State:          Running
IPv4:           10.49.93.29
Release:        Ubuntu Kinetic Kudu (development branch)
Image hash:     5cb61a7d834d (Ubuntu 22.10)
CPU(s):         1
Load:           0.10 0.06 0.02
Disk usage:     1.4G out of 4.7G
Memory usage:   161.8M out of 971.2M

```

## Create an instance with multiple network interfaces

See also: launch ... --network

Multipass can launch instances with additional network interfaces, via the --network option. That is complemented by the networks command, to find available host networks to bridge with.

This is supported only for images with cloud-init support for Version 2 network config, which in turn requires netplan to be installed. So, from 17.10 and core 16 onward, except for snapcraft:core16. And then only in the following scenarios:

on Linux, with LXD
on Windows, with both Hyper-V and VirtualBox
on macOS, with the QEMU and VirtualBox drivers
The --network option can be given multiple times, each one requesting an additional network interface (beyond the default one, which is always present). Each use takes an argument specifying the properties of the desired interface:

name ‚Äî the only required value, it identifies the host network to connect the instance‚Äôs device to (see networks for possible values)
mode ‚Äî either auto (the default) or manual; with auto, the instance will attempt automatic network configuration
mac ‚Äî a custom MAC address to use for the device

These properties can be specified in the format <key>=<value>,‚Ä¶. but a simpler form with only <name> is available for the most common use-case. Here is an example:

$ multipass launch --network en0 --network name=bridge0,mode=manual
Launched: upbeat-whipsnake

$ multipass exec upbeat-whipsnake -- ip -br address show scope global
enp0s3           UP             10.0.2.15/24
enp0s8           UP             192.168.1.146/24
enp0s9           DOWN

$ ping -c1 192.168.1.146  # elsewhere in the same network
PING 192.168.1.146 (192.168.1.146): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.1.146: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.378 ms
[...]
In the example above, we got the following interfaces inside the instance:

enp0s3 ‚Äî the default interface, that the instance can use to reach the outside world and which Multipass uses to communicate with the instance;
enp0s8 ‚Äî the interface that is connected to en0 on the host and which is automatically configured;
enp0s9 ‚Äî the interface that is connected to bridge0 on the host, ready for manual configuration.
