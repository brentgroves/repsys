# AI Overview: how does kvm link tap device to vnic

In KVM, a TAP device (a virtual network interface) is linked to a vNIC (virtual network interface card) within the guest virtual machine by creating a bridge on the host, then attaching the TAP device to that bridge, and configuring the guest's network settings to use the bridge.
Here's a more detailed explanation:

1. Bridging on the Host:
Create a Bridge:
A bridge is a virtual network device that acts as a switch, connecting multiple network interfaces.
Add TAP Device to Bridge:
The TAP device, which represents the virtual network interface on the host, is added to the bridge.
Add Physical Interface to Bridge (Optional):
You can optionally add a physical network interface to the bridge to allow the VM to access the external network.
Configure Bridge IP Address:
Assign an IP address to the bridge, which will be used as the gateway for the VM.
2. Configuring the Guest VM:
Virtual NIC:
Inside the VM, a virtual NIC (vNIC) is configured to use the bridge's IP address as its gateway.
Network Configuration:
Set up the VM's network settings, including its IP address, subnet mask, and DNS server, ensuring it can communicate with the host and the external network through the bridge.
DHCP (Optional):
You can configure the bridge to act as a DHCP server, allowing the VM to automatically obtain an IP address.
3. How it Works:
When the VM sends or receives network traffic, the traffic is routed through the virtual NIC, which is connected to the bridge.
The bridge acts as a switch, forwarding the traffic to the TAP device, which then forwards it to the host's physical network interface (if configured).
Conversely, traffic from the host's network is routed through the bridge to the VM.
Example using virsh (libvirt):
Create a bridge.
Code

    virsh net-define <network_name.xml>
    virsh net-start <network_name>
Attach the VM to the bridge.
Code

    virsh attach-interface <vm_name> --interface tap0 --source tap --driver tap
Configure the VM's network settings.
Code

    virsh edit <vm_name>
Within the XML configuration, specify the bridge's IP address as the gateway for the VM's network interface.
