Stop the VM: Before deleting, you need to stop the virtual machine. Use the following command, replacing <vm_name> with the actual name of your VM:
Code

   lxc stop <vm_name>
Delete the VM: Once the VM is stopped, you can delete it using:
Code

   lxc delete <vm_name>
Force Deletion (Optional): If you need to delete a running VM, use the --force flag:
Code

   lxc delete <vm_name> --force
Important Notes:
The lxc delete command permanently deletes the instance and its snapshots, according to the LXD documentation.
Be absolutely sure you want to delete the VM before executing the command, as this action is irreversible.
If you are removing LXD entirely, you'll need to remove containers, images, storage volumes, and networks first, then remove LXD itself, according to the Linux Containers forum.

If an LXD VM won't stop, it's likely due to a pending operation or a stuck process. To resolve this, you can try cancelling pending tasks or forcefully stopping the VM. If the issue persists, killing the relevant lxc-start process or the monitor process might be necessary.
Here's a breakdown of potential solutions:

1. Check for Pending Tasks:
Pending operations:
If a shutdown or other operation is pending, it can block subsequent stop commands.
lxc monitor:
Use lxc monitor <vm_name> in a separate terminal to see if there are any ongoing operations.
Cancellation:
If a shutdown command is pending, you might need to cancel it before stopping the VM.
Code

# Check for pending tasks

lxc monitor <vm_name>

# If a shutdown is pending, you may need to cancel it. The exact command will depend on the context

# For example

# lxc stop <vm_name> --force

2. Forceful Stop:
lxc stop <vm_name> --force: This attempts a forceful stop, but it might not always work.
kill -9 <PID>: If the VM is unresponsive, you can try killing the lxc-start process or the monitor process associated with the VM.
Code

# Find the PID of the lxc-start process

ps -ef | grep lxc-start | grep <vm_name>

# Kill the process

sudo kill -9 <PID>

# Find the PID of the monitor process

ps -eF | grep '<vm_name>' | grep 'lxc monitor'

# Kill the monitor process

kill -9 <PID>
