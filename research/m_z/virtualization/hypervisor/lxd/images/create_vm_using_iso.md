n this video, we'll take a look at how to install a custom Linux desktop operating system, on an LXD virtual machine, directly from a bootable ISO file! LXD allows you to attach an ISO as a "disk" device, to a VM. Using an open source utility called virt-viewer, which utilizes the SPICE remoting protocol, you can view the graphical console of an LXD VM, just like if you had a monitor attached to it. Using these techniques together, you can install just about any Linux desktop distribution that you want to use on your virtual infrastructure!

After the Linux VM has been set up, you can install the "xrdp" package and use the RDP protocol to remotely connect to it. RDP provides a much richer and crisp rendering experience than other protocols, like SPICE or VNC.

By running Linux desktop distributions on your LXD server, you can easily develop and test applications across different environments. The more testing you perform, as a developer, you help to ensure your users have a positive experience on whatever platform they choose.
