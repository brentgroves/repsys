Terminology
Ceph uses the term object for the data that it stores. The daemon that is responsible for storing and managing data is the Ceph OSD. Cephâ€™s storage is divided into pools, which are logical partitions for storing objects. They are also referred to as data pools, storage pools or OSD pools.

Ceph block devices are also called RBD images, and you can create snapshots and clones of these RBD images.
