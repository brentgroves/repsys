## how do we share data between users from a ceph share

Sharing data between users in a Ceph environment
Sharing data between users in a Ceph environment involves leveraging Ceph's built-in access control mechanisms, including user management, capabilities, and potentially integrating with file system protocols or object storage gateways.

## Here's a breakdown of the key concepts and methods

1. Ceph user management
Users: Ceph identifies users (both individuals and applications) using a "period-delimited form" like client.user1.
Authentication and Authorization: When Ceph runs with authentication and authorization enabled (the default setting), users must provide a user name and a keyring containing a secret key for authentication.
Capabilities (Caps): Capabilities define the permissions granted to an authenticated user for interacting with Ceph components like monitors (mon), OSDs (osd), and metadata servers (mds). Capabilities can also restrict access to specific data within pools, namespaces, or sets of pools based on application tags.
Managing Users: Ceph provides tools and commands like ceph auth add, ceph auth get, ceph auth caps, and ceph-authtool to create, list, modify, and delete users and their capabilities.

## 2. Sharing via CephFS (Ceph File System)

Mounting Directories: You can mount a directory from CephFS to a client system (e.g., a Linux VM).
Controlling Access: For CephFS, you can modify Access Control Lists (ACLs) on the shared paths using utilities like chmod, chown, or setfacl to control which users have access and what permissions they have.
User Capabilities for CephFS: When authorizing CephFS clients, you grant capabilities that define what they can do within the file system (e.g., read, write, create snapshots) and to which paths or file systems they have access.

## 3. Sharing via Ceph Object Gateway (S3/Swift)

User Management for Object Storage: The Ceph Object Gateway has its own user management system that authenticates and authorizes users to access S3 and Swift APIs, which hold user data.
Access Keys and Secrets: Users of the S3 API and Swift API are identified by access keys and secrets for authentication.
Admin Users: You can create administrative users with the ability to manage other users and their permissions for buckets or containers.

## 4. CephFS and RGW Exports over NFS

NFS-Ganesha: CephFS namespaces and RGW buckets can be exported over the NFS protocol using the NFS-Ganesha NFS server.
NFS Manager Module: The Ceph nfs manager module provides a way to manage NFS exports via the CLI or dashboard.
Creating Exports: You can create CephFS exports using commands like ceph nfs export create cephfs <fsname> <clusterid> <binding>.

Important security considerations
Network Security: Implement network segmentation, firewalls, and secure communication protocols like Ceph's built-in encryption in transit (messenger v2 protocol) to protect data moving through the network.
Data at Rest Encryption: Ceph supports encrypting data stored within OSDs, preventing unauthorized access even if physical access to the storage media is obtained.
Regular Audits and Monitoring: Regularly review access logs and system behavior for unusual patterns or anomalies to detect potential security breaches.
Key Management: Implement secure key management practices, including key rotation, to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of your data.
By understanding and implementing these security measures and sharing strategies, you can effectively and securely share data between users in your Ceph environment.

## **[Windows File Sharing and Ceph Clustering](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/oyhlb4/windows_file_sharing_and_ceph_clustering_both/)** - Both Made Simple with Cockpit (Houston) File Explorer and File Sharing Modules

Guide/How-to
Hey everyone, 45Drives back again with another pretty cool piece of information. I wanted to share another sought after piece of content for the open-source storage community and more specifically, for Cockpit/Houston users.

Recently, Our R&D team built a visual file-explorer for Cockpit and called it the Navigator. Our team has also developed a file sharing module inside Cockpit that takes Samba and NFS and breaks them out into their own module. This module gives you the ability to quickly and easily create Samba or NFS shares with a single server or in a clustered configuration. Now, using both of these modules together, it makes building Ceph clusters way easier. AND... gets you out of the command line (if you desire).

I suggest you check out this tutorial on how to utilize both of these features for your next Ceph cluster build. Check out the tutorial here.

For anyone who wishes to access the installation packages, you can from our GitHub here.

Tons of tutorials and technical docs that can assist with these installations are found on our Knowledgebase.

Hope these features help some of you.
