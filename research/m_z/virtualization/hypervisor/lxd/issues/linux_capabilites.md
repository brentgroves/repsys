# **[Exploiting Linux Capabilities – Part 1](<https://tbhaxor.com/exploiting-linux-capabilities-part-1/>)**

Get the practical knowledge on how to abuse cap_setuid and cap_setgid capabilities in Linux to get the root user shell

As I have discussed capabilities in my previous post, there are 40 capabilities, but from an infosec point of view, I will discuss around 20 of them. Fitting writeup for all of them in one post in nearly one post is nearly impossible. I will discuss 4 labs in each post

In this post, I will discuss 2 capabilities related to setuid and setgid. If you want a refresher on them, I have written two posts – Demystifying SUID and SGID bits and Exploiting SUID Binaries to Get Root User Shell
