Distribution: Ubuntu 22.04.3
Distribution version:

Issue description
Trying to start an existing LXD Windows 11 vm but after 30 seconds the LXD VM Stops

Tried to create/install a New Windows 11 Pro vm and during installation it too Stops after about
10-15 seconds.

Steps to reproduce
I just followed the Canonical Guide:
<https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-install-a-windows-11-vm-using-lxd#3-create-a-new-vm>

However, I the only change I did was to make the Windows 11 VM size = 60GiB
$ lxc start win11 --console=vga

Windows 11 starts and appears on the screen. Even if I do not do anything further...the LXD Windows 11 VM will just Stop after 10-15 seconds.

This was all working 2 weeks ago?

Note creating/running an Ubuntu LXD VM works just fine.

So I suspect a couple of things.

Perhaps something Distrobuilder - and whatever magic it does.
Some problem with the newer Linux 6.2.x.x kernels that get installed?
Some possible Change in Qemu
NOTE: On a separate system I installed Ubuntu 23.10 (Kernel 6.5.0.9) & LXD (5.19) and same thing happens where
Windows starts to boot gets to first install menu and then the Windows 11 LXD container goes into "stopped" state.

I'd think it should be quick & easy to replicate by someone as nothing beyond defaults were used.

Incus and LXD both fail exactly the same trying to install/run Win11 despite the fact that an Ubuntu 22.04 VM installs & runs just fine.

After spending a week troubleshooting this and no solution I bit the bullet and reinstalled Ubuntu 22.04.3 and restored /home from backup and now both Incus & LXD create/run a Win11 Pro VM ok again.

```bash
# get
sysctl kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_unconfined
kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_unconfined = 0
sysctl kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns
kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns = 1

# set
sudo sysctl -w kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_unconfined=0
sudo sysctl -w kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0
```
