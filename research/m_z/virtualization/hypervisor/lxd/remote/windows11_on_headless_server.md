# **[Install Windows 11 VM on Ubuntu Linux Server!](<<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amslKipAjxo>)**

In this video, we'll install Microsoft Windows 11 onto a Linux virtual machine, using LXD! LXD supports attaching virtual Trusted Platform Modules (TPM) to VMs, so Windows 11 is fully compatible. There is one extra step that's a bit unique, which involves using distrobuilder to inject device drivers into the Windows operating system image ISO before installation. After installing Windows 11 on an LXD VM, we'll enable the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service and make sure we can remotely access the system.
