# Connect to the VM's VGA console

## AI Overview

To connect to a running LXD virtual machine (VM) using the VGA console, you need to use the lxc console command with the --type vga option. You'll also need a SPICE client like virt-viewer or spicy installed on your system.
Steps:

1. Install a SPICE client:
.
If you don't have one already, install a SPICE client like virt-viewer or spicy. On Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt install virt-viewer or sudo apt install spicy. On Fedora/CentOS: sudo dnf install virt-viewer or sudo dnf install spice-gtk. On Windows, you can use the manual installer or install via Chocolatey.

spicy is a legacy, and now obsolete, SPICE client, while virt-viewer is the recommended client for connecting to a virtual machine using the SPICE protocol. Virt-viewer provides a graphical interface for displaying the guest OS, supporting both VNC and SPICE protocols. Essentially, spicy is a test application and not the primary tool for SPICE connections.

Use the following command: lxc console <vm_name> --type vga. Replace <vm_name> with the name of your virtual machine. This command will launch the SPICE client and connect it to the VM's VGA console, allowing you to see the graphical output.
Example:
Code

```bash
sudo apt install virt-viewer
lxc remote list
lxc remote switch micro11
# bring up virt-viewer after starting mystudio
lxc start mystudio --console=vga
lxc launch images:ubuntu/noble/desktop v1 --vm
# or if vm is already running
lxc console mystudio --type vga
```

This will open a graphical window displaying the console of the VM named my_vm.
Note:
The lxc console command with --type vga is specifically designed for accessing the graphical console of VMs, providing access to the VM's output, even before the lxd-agent is running.
If you're having trouble connecting, ensure the LXD daemon is running and that the SPICE client is properly installed and configured.
You can also use the lxc query command with a POST request to the console endpoint for more control over the connection, including specifying the width and height of the console window, according to the Ubuntu documentation.
