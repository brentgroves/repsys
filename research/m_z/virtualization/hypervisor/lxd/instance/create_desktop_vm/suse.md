AI Overview
To install an openSUSE Tumbleweed KDE desktop environment using LXD, you will create a virtual machine (VM) rather than a container, as this is the recommended and simplest method for running a full graphical desktop. You will use the official community images, launch the VM with sufficient resources, and then connect to it with a remote desktop viewer.
Prerequisites
LXD Installation: You must have LXD installed and configured on your host system. The easiest method is to use snapd: sudo snap install lxd.
LXD Initialization: Initialize LXD by running lxd init and accepting the default settings.
Permissions: Add your user account to the lxd group to manage instances without sudo. After adding, log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.
sh
sudo usermod -aG lxd $USER
newgrp lxd # For the current session

Step 1: Launch the VM
Use the lxc launch command to create and start the virtual machine with the openSUSE Tumbleweed KDE image.
The --vm flag specifies that it should be a virtual machine.
Specify resource limits for the CPU and memory. A minimum of 4GiB of memory is recommended for a desktop VM.
The --console=vga flag enables the graphical console, allowing you to connect with a viewer.
sh
lxc launch images:opensuse/tumbleweed/desktop-kde opensuse-desktop-kde --vm -c limits.cpu=4 -c limits.memory=4GiB --console=vga
Step 2: View the desktop
After the VM is launched and the image is downloaded, a remote viewer window will open automatically, displaying the KDE desktop. This may take a few moments.
If the remote viewer does not appear automatically, you can explicitly connect to the VM's console using this command:
sh
lxc console opensuse-desktop-kde --type=vga
Step 3: Log in
Once the desktop environment is loaded in the viewer, you will be prompted to log in.
Username: opensuse
Password: linux
Step 4: Access the internet
Your new VM should have network access via a default NAT network provided by LXD. To test the connection, you can open a web browser like Firefox inside the KDE desktop.
Step 5: (Optional) Make a snapshot
If you want to save the current state of your VM, you can take a snapshot. This is useful for returning to a previous state at any time.
sh
lxc snapshot opensuse-desktop-kde <snapshot-name>
Step 6: Stop and delete the VM
When you are finished with the VM, you can stop and delete it with the following commands.
Stop the VM:
sh
lxc stop opensuse-desktop-kde
Delete the VM:
sh
lxc delete opensuse-desktop-kde
