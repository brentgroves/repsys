Default storage pool
There is no concept of a default storage pool in LXD.

When you create a storage volume, you must specify the storage pool to use.

When LXD automatically creates a storage volume during instance creation, it uses the storage pool that is configured for the instance. This configuration can be set in either of the following ways:

Directly on an instance: lxc launch <image> <instance_name> --storage <storage_pool>

Through a profile: lxc profile device add <profile_name> root disk path=/ pool=<storage_pool> and lxc launch <image> <instance_name> --profile <profile_name>

Through the default profile

In a profile, the storage pool to use is defined by the pool for the root disk device:

  root:
    type: disk
    path: /
    pool: default
In the default profile, this pool is set to the storage pool that was created during initialization.

How to create an instance in a specific storage pool
Instance storage volumes are created in the storage pool that is specified by the instanceâ€™s root disk device. This configuration is normally provided by the profile or profiles applied to the instance. See Default storage pool for detailed information.
