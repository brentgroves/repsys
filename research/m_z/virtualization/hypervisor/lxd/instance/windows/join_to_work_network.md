If you want to add or register your personal device, such as your phone, see Register your personal device on your organization's network.

While you're joining your Windows device to your work or school network, the following actions will happen:

Windows registers your device to your work or school network, letting you access your resources using your personal account. After your device is registered, Windows then joins your device to the network, so you can use your work or school username and password to sign in and access restricted resources.

Optionally, based on your organization's choices, you might be asked to set up two-step verification through either two-step verification or security info.

Optionally, based on your organization's choices, you might be automatically enrolled in mobile device management, such as Microsoft Intune. For more info about enrolling in Microsoft Intune, see Enroll your device in Intune.

You can make sure that you're joined by looking at your settings.

Open Settings, and then select Accounts.

Accounts on the Settings screen

Select Access work or school, and make sure you see text that says something like Connected to <your_organization> Entra ID.

Next steps
After you join your device to your organization's network, you should be able to access all of your resources using your work or school account information.

If your organization is managed using Microsoft Intune and you have questions about enrollment, sign-in, or any other Intune-related issue, see the Intune user help content.
