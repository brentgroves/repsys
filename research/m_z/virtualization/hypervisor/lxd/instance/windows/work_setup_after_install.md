Go to Accounts.

Click Connect or + Add a work or school account.
Select Join this device to Azure Active Directory.
Enter your organizational email address and follow the prompts to sign in with your password and approve your device.

## 2. Install Drivers and Updates

- Go to Settings > Update & Security.
- Select Windows Update and click Check for updates.
- Download and install all available updates and drivers.
- To verify drivers, right-click the Start button, select Device Manager, and check for any yellow exclamation marks or unknown devices. If you find any, visit your PC manufacturer's website to download and install the correct drivers.

## 3. Install Business Applications

After Windows is up to date, you can install your work-related applications.
You may need to download and install software from a shared network drive or the company's software portal.
Some applications may also be available to install from the Microsoft Store or through your web browser, like Microsoft Outlook or Edge.

## 4. Additional Setup

Configure Multiple Desktops:
If you need a more organized workspace, you can create additional virtual desktops by using the Task View button (two overlapping squares) on the taskbar or by pressing Windows key + Tab.
Check Privacy Settings:
Review your privacy settings in the Windows Settings app to ensure they align with your organization's policies.
