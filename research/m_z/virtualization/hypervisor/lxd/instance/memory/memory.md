To increase the memory allocated to an LXD container or virtual machine, you can use the lxc config set command with the limits.memory option, or adjust it through the LXD dashboard, profile, or API. Ensure the container is stopped before resizing memory, and consider the host's available resources.
This video demonstrates how to manage CPU and memory resources for LXD virtual machines, including how to increase the memory allocation:

Here's a breakdown of the process:
Stop the instance: Before resizing memory, you need to stop the LXD container or virtual machine.
Code

   lxc stop <instance_name>
Set the new memory limit: Use the lxc config set command to modify the memory allocation. Specify the instance name and the new memory limit using the limits.memory option. You can use units like MB or GB.
Code

   lxc config set <instance_name> limits.memory=<new_memory_size>
For example, to increase the memory to 2GB:
Code

   lxc config set <instance_name> limits.memory=2GB
Start the instance: After setting the new memory limit, start the instance for the change to take effect.
Code

   lxc start <instance_name>
Alternative methods:
LXD dashboard: If you're using the LXD dashboard, you can navigate to the instance's settings and modify the memory allocation there.
Profiles: You can also manage memory limits through profiles, which allow you to apply the same configuration to multiple instances.
API: The LXD API can also be used to manage memory limits.
Important considerations:
Host resources:
Ensure that the host machine has enough available memory to accommodate the increased allocation.
Hot-plug:
While you can dynamically add or remove CPU cores without stopping a virtual machine, memory resizing typically requires a restart.
Current usage:
If you try to increase the memory beyond the current usage on a running instance, it might produce an error. You may need to stop the instance first.
