Standard devices
LXD provides each instance with the basic devices that are required for a standard POSIX system to work. These devices arenâ€™t visible in the instance or profile configuration, and they may not be overridden.

The standard devices are:

| Device       | Type of device    |
|--------------|-------------------|
| /dev/null    | Character device  |
| /dev/zero    | Character device  |
| /dev/full    | Character device  |
| /dev/console | Character device  |
| /dev/tty     | Character device  |
| /dev/random  | Character device  |
| /dev/urandom | Character device  |
| /dev/net/tun | Character device  |
| /dev/fuse    | Character device  |
| lo           | Network interface |

FUSE  (Filesystem  in  Userspace)  is  a  simple  interface  for  userspace  programs to export a virtual filesystem to the Linux kernel. FUSE also aims to provide a secure method for  non  privileged  users  to create and mount their own filesystem implementations.

Any other devices must be defined in the instance configuration or in one of the profiles used by the instance. The default profile typically contains a network interface that becomes eth0 in the instance.
