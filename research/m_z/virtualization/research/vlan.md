## What is a VLAN (virtual LAN)?

A virtual LAN (VLAN) is a logical overlay network that groups together a subset of devices that share a physical LAN, isolating the traffic for each group.

A LAN is a group of computers or other devices in the same place -- e.g., the same building or campus -- that share the same physical network. A LAN is usually associated with an Ethernet (Layer 2) broadcast domain, which is the set of network devices an Ethernet broadcast packet can reach.
