## Single-node quickstart

This tutorial shows how to install OpenStack (based on project Sunbeam) in the simplest way possible. It will deploy an OpenStack 2024.1 (Caracal) cloud.

The cloud will only allow access to its VMs from the local host. To enable access from any host on your network, follow the Single-node guided tutorial instead.

## Requirements

You will need a single machine whose requirements are:

physical or virtual machine running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
a multi-core amd64 processor ideally with 4+ cores
a minimum of 16 GiB of free memory
100 GiB of SSD storage available on the root disk

Caution: Any change in IP address of the local host will be detrimental to the deployment. A virtual host will generally have a more stable address.

## Deploy the cloud

## Install the openstack snap

Duration: 5 minutes
Depending on internet connection speed to required resources may be shorter or longer.

Begin by installing the openstack snap:

```bash
sudo snap install openstack
```

## Prepare the machine

Sunbeam can generate a script to ensure that the machine has all of the required dependencies installed and is configured correctly for use in OpenStack - you can review this script using:

```bash
sunbeam prepare-node-script --bootstrap

+ echo 'Sunbeam requires the LXD bridge to be called anything except lxdbr0'
Sunbeam requires the LXD bridge to be called anything except lxdbr0
+ exit 1

# uninstalled the lxd snap and the following script reinstalled it

sunbeam prepare-node-script --bootstrap | bash -x && newgrp snap_daemon

```

## Bootstrap the cloud

Deploy the OpenStack cloud using the cluster bootstrap command:

```bash
# sunbeam cluster bootstrap
sunbeam cluster bootstrap --accept-defaults

```

You will first be prompted whether or not to enable network proxy usage. If ‘Yes’, several sub-questions will be asked.

Use proxy to access external network resources? [y/n] (y):
http_proxy ():
https_proxy ():
no_proxy ():
Note that proxy settings can also be supplied by using a manifest (see Deployment manifest).

When prompted, enter the CIDR and the address range for the control plane networking. Here we use the values given earlier:

Management network (172.16.1.0/24):
OpenStack APIs IP ranges (172.16.1.201-172.16.1.240): 172.16.1.201-172.16.1.220

## Configure the cloud and obtain credentials

Now configure the deployed cloud using the configure command:

```bash
sunbeam configure --openrc demo-openrc
# VMs will be accessible only from the local host or only from remote hosts. For remote, you must specify the network interface dedicated to VM access traffic. The intended remote hosts 
# must have connectivity to this interface.

172.24.188.57/23
gw:172.24.189.254
8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
```

The --openrc option specifies a regular user (non-admin) cloud init file (demo-openrc here).

A series of questions will now be asked. Below is the output of an entire interactive session on research21. The values in square brackets, when present, provide acceptable values. A value in parentheses is the default value. Here we use the values given earlier:

```bash
sunbeam configure --openrc demo-openrc    

VMs will be accessible only from the local host or only from remote hosts. For remote, you must specify the network interface dedicated to VM access traffic. The intended remote hosts 
must have connectivity to this interface.
Local or remote access to VMs [local/remote] (local): 
Network from which the instances will be remotely accessed (outside OpenStack). Takes the form of a CIDR block.
External network - arbitrary but must not be in use (172.16.2.0/24): 
VMs intended to be accessed from remote hosts will be assigned dedicated addresses from a portion of the physical network (outside OpenStack). Takes the form of an IP range.
External network's allocation range (172.16.2.2-172.16.2.254): 
Type of network to use for external access.
External network's type  [flat/vlan] (flat): 
If enabled, demonstration resources will be created on the cloud.
Populate OpenStack cloud with demo user, default images, flavors etc [y/n] (y): 
Username for the demonstration user.
Username to use for access to OpenStack (demo): 
Password for the demonstration user.
Password to use for access to OpenStack (8u********): 
Network range for the private network for the demonstration user's project. Typically an unroutable network (RFC 1918).
Project network (192.168.0.0/24): 
A list of DNS server IP addresses (comma separated) that should be used for external DNS resolution from cloud instances. If not specified, the system's default nameservers will be 
used.
Project network's nameservers (10.92.6.1 8.8.4.4 8.8.8.8): 
If enabled, security groups will be created with rules to allow ICMP and SSH access to instances.
Enable ping and SSH access to instances? [y/n] (y): 
⠴ Generating openrc for cloud admin usage ... Writing openrc to demo-openrc ... done
The cloud has been configured for sample usage.
You can start using the OpenStack client or access the OpenStack dashboard at http://172.16.1.204:80/openstack-horizon

```

## Launch a VM

Verify the cloud by launching a VM called ‘test’ based on the ‘ubuntu’ image (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS). The launch command is used:

```bash
sunbeam launch ubuntu --name test
```

Sample output:

```bash
Launching an OpenStack instance ... 
Access the instance by running the following command:
`ssh -i /home/brent/snap/openstack/727/sunbeam ubuntu@172.16.2.76`

```
