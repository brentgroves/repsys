# **[Hyper-converged infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-converged_infrastructure)**

The primary difference between converged infrastructure and hyperconverged infrastructure is that in HCI both the storage area network and the underlying storage abstractions[clarification needed] are implemented virtually in software (at or via the hypervisor) rather than physically in hardware.[1][2] Because software-defined elements are implemented in the context of the hypervisor, management of all resources can be federated (shared) across all instances of a hyper-converged infrastructure.
