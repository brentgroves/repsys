## Single-node

For single-node deployments the following minimum hardware specification applies:

| Component             | Specification         | Notes                                                   |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| CPU                   | 4 core                | amd64 only                                              |
| RAM                   | 16 GiB                |                                                         |
| Root Disk             | 100 GiB of free space | SSD                                                     |
| Control plane network | 1 Gbps                | Mainly localhost only networking so minimal requirement |
| External network      | 1 Gbps                | Optional - only required for remote access to instances |
| Storage               | 1 x 100 GiB SSD       | Optional - only required for block storage service      |

Note

A single-node deployment has no resilience and has limited performance.

## Multi-node

For multi-node deployments the following minimum hardware specification applies:

| Component                     | Specification         | Notes                                         |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| CPU                           | 16 core               | amd64 only                                    |
| RAM                           | 32 GiB                |                                               |
| Root Disk                     | 500 GiB of free space | SSD                                           |
| Control plane network network | 1 Gbps                | Supports east/west traffic                    |
| External network              | 1 Gbps                | Supports north/south traffic                  |
| Storage                       | 1 x 500 GiB SSD       | Required for block storage and image services |

Note

Three nodes are required for multi-node operation.

## Role Based Minimum Memory Sizing

For multi-node deployments the following minimum component memory sizing may be used to size each node based on the roles it hosts within the deployment:

| Component          | Kubernetes | Ceph OSD      | Ceph MON/MGR | Ceph RGW | Control Plane | SunbeamD | Juju Controller | Sunbeam Client |
|--------------------|------------|---------------|--------------|----------|---------------|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Control            | 4 GiB      |               |              |          | 10 GiB        |          |                 |                |
| Compute            |            |               |              |          | 1 GiB         |          |                 |                |
| Storage            |            | 5 GiB per OSD | 2 GiB        | 2 GiB    |               |          |                 |                |
| Cloud              | 4 GiB      | 5 GiB per OSD | 2 GiB        | 2 GiB    | 11 GiB        |          |                 |                |
| Sunbeam Controller |            |               |              |          |               | 4 GiB    |                 |                |
| Sunbeam Client     |            |               |              |          |               |          |                 | 1 GiB          |
| Juju Controller    |            |               |              |          |               |          | 4 GiB           |                |

Note

For Ceph components, the scale of the deployment will have an impact on the memory footprint for MON/MGR daemons (3 nodes) and more memory and cores may be needed per Ceph OSD if using NVMe drives instead of SSD of spinning disks.
