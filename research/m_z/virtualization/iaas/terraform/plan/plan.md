The core Terraform workflow consists of three main steps after you have written your Terraform configuration:

- Initialize prepares your workspace so Terraform can apply your configuration.
- Plan allows you to preview the changes Terraform will make before you apply them.
- Apply makes the changes defined by your plan to create, update, or destroy resources.
