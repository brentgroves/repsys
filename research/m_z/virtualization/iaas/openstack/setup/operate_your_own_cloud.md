OpenStack is an open source software that provides cloud infrastructure for virtual machines, bare metal, and containers.

In this article, you will learn how to use OpenStack to operate your own private cloud.

By the end of the tutorial, you will have a core understanding of what OpenStack is and you will know the basics of setting up and administering OpenStack using the OpenMetal platform. You will also understand some commonly used OpenStack services.

In addition to creating this article version of the tutorial, I also created a video version. You can watch the video on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel.

To follow along with this tutorial, it can be helpful to have a basic understanding of the Linux command line, networking, and virtualization. But none of it is required.

Thanks to OpenMetal for sponsoring this tutorial.
