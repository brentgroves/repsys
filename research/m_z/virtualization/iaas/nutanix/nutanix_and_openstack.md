## Here's a more detailed explanation

## Nutanix and OpenStack Integration

Nutanix has specifically developed drivers that allow their Acropolis technology to integrate with OpenStack services.

## Benefits of Integration

This integration allows organizations to combine the simplicity and ease of use of Nutanix's infrastructure with the flexibility and open APIs of OpenStack.

## OpenStack Services

Nutanix provides drivers for core OpenStack services like Nova (compute), Cinder (block storage), Glance (image management), and Neutron (networking).

## Deployment

Nutanix has a CLI (command-line interface) with three commands to configure the drivers, connect them to the OpenStack controller, and connect Nutanix infrastructure to the drivers, enabling quick and easy integration.

## OpenStack vs. Nutanix

While OpenStack aims for complete abstraction of resources and Amazon-like APIs, Nutanix is more focused on enterprise-grade features, ease of use, and optimized for stateful workloads, according to a **[Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/3h2j8a/nutanix_vs_openstack_vs_other_platforms/)**.

## Other Integrations

Nutanix also integrates with other cloud platforms and tools, such as Platform9, Red Hat, and VMware vRealize Suite.
