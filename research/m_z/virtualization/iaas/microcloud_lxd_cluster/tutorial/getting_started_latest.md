# **[Getting Started latest](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/microcloud/latest/microcloud/tutorial/get_started/)**

Get started with MicroCloud
MicroCloud is quick to set up. Once **[installed](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/microcloud/latest/microcloud/how-to/install/#howto-install)**, you can start using MicroCloud in the same way as a regular LXD cluster.

This tutorial guides you through installing and initializing MicroCloud in a confined environment, then starting some instances to see what you can do with MicroCloud. It uses LXD virtual machines (VMs) for the MicroCloud cluster members, so you donâ€™t need any extra hardware to follow the tutorial.

Tip

While VMs are used as cluster members for this tutorial, we recommend that you use physical machines in a production environment. You can use VMs as cluster members in testing or development environments. To do so, your host machine must have nested virtualization enabled. See the **[Ubuntu Server documentation](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/server/how-to/virtualisation/enable-nested-virtualisation/#check-if-nested-virtualisation-is-enabled)** on how to check if nested virtualization is enabled.

We also limit each machine in this tutorial to 2 GiB of RAM, which is less than the recommended hardware requirements. In the context of this tutorial, this amount of RAM is sufficient. However, in a production environment, make sure to use machines that fulfill the **[Hardware requirements](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/microcloud/latest/microcloud/reference/requirements/#reference-requirements-hardware)**.
