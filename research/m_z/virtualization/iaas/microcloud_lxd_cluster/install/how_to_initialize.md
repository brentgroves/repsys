# **[How to initialize Microcloud](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/microcloud/latest/microcloud/how-to/initialize/)**

The **[initialization process](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/microcloud/latest/microcloud/explanation/initialization/#explanation-initialization)** bootstraps the MicroCloud cluster. You run the initialization on one of the machines, and it configures the required services on all of the machines that have been joined.

Pre-initialization requirements
Complete the steps in **[How to install MicroCloud](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/microcloud/latest/microcloud/how-to/install/#howto-install)** before initialization.

If you intend to use full disk encryption (FDE) on any cluster member, that member must meet the prerequisites listed on this page: Full disk encryption.

Follow only the instructions in the Prerequisites section on that page. Skip its Usage section; the MicroCloud initialization process handles the disk encryption.
