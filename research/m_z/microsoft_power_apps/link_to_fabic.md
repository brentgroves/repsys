# **[Link to Fabric from Power Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/data-platform/azure-synapse-link-view-in-fabric#link-to-fabric-from-power-apps)**

From the Tables area in Power Apps (make.powerapps.com), makers link to Fabric by selecting Analyze > Link to Microsoft Fabric on the command bar.

When you select the command for the first time, a wizard driven experience links your Dataverse environment to a Fabric workspace. A Fabric Lakehouse, SQL endpoint, a Power BI dataset are created and Dataverse tables are linked to the lakehouse via shortcuts.

Once the link is set up, you can grant other users access to the Fabric workspace so that they can work with Dataverse data using all Fabric workloads. The lakehouse, SQL endpoint, and Power BI dataset are updated with new data as changes occur in Dataverse.
