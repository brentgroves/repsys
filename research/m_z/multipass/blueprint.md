# **[Multipass Blueprint](https://multipass.run/docs/blueprint)**

In Multipass, a blueprint is a recipe to create a customised Multipass instance.

Blueprints consist of a base image, cloud-init initialisation, and a set of parameters describing the instance itself, e.g. minimum memory, CPUs or disk.

Blueprints are defined from a YAML file with the following schema:

## v1/<name>.yaml

```yaml
description: <string>      # *a short description of the blueprint ("tagline")
version: <string>          #* a version string

runs-on:                   # a list of architectures this blueprint can run on

- arm64                    #   see <https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qsysinfo.html#currentCpuArchitecture>
- x86_64                   #   for a list of valid values

instances:
  <name>:                  # * equal to the blueprint name
    image: <base image>    # a valid image alias, see `multipass find` for available values
    limits:
      min-cpu: <int>       # the minimum number of CPUs this blueprint can work with
      min-mem: <string>    # the minimum amount of memory (can use G/K/M/B suffixes)
      min-disk: <string>   # and the minimum disk size (as above)
    timeout: <int>         # maximum time for the instance to launch, and separately for cloud-init to complete
    cloud-init:
      vendor-data: |       # cloud-init vendor data
        <string>

health-check: |            # a health-check shell script ran by integration tests
  <string>
```

Blueprints currently integrated into Multipass can be found with the **[multipass find](https://multipass.run/docs/find-command)** command.

```bash
multipass find

## Github readme

Multipass Blueprints
This repository contains Multipass Blueprint definitions. They augment the offerings already available from the Ubuntu Cloud Images. You can list the available images with multipass find and run them with multipass launch:

```bash
$ multipass find
Image                       Aliases           Version          Description
# ...
minikube                                      latest           minikube is local Kubernetes

$ multipass launch minikube
Launched: minikube

$ multipass exec minikube -- minikube status
minikube
type: Control Plane
host: Running
kubelet: Running
apiserver: Running
kubeconfig: Configured
```

## Testing

On Linux, the multipass find command looks for blueprints in a URL provided by an environment variable, MULTIPASS_BLUEPRINTS_URL. To locally test your blueprints you would need to override the systemd service with the following setting:

[Service]

```bash
Environment="MULTIPASS_BLUEPRINTS_URL=https://github.com/USERNAME/multipass-blueprints/archive/refs/heads/BRANCH_NAME.zip"
This can be done by using the systemctl edit utility:

sudo systemctl edit snap.multipass.multipassd.service
followed by service restart:

sudo snap restart multipass
```
