## **[Configure Static IP](https://multipass.run/docs/configure-static-ips)**

This document explains how to create instances with static IPs in a new network, internal to the host. With this approach, instances get an extra IP that does not change with restarts. By using a separate, local network we avoid any IP conflicts. Instances retain the usual default interface with a DHCP-allocated IP, which gives them connectivity to the outside.

**[Multipass on Ubuntu with Bridged Network Interfaces](https://jon.sprig.gs/blog/post/2800)**

Iâ€™m working on a new project, and I am using Multipass on an Ubuntu machine to provision some virtual machines on my local machine using cloudinit files. All good so far!

I wanted to expose one of the services Iâ€™ve created to the bridged network (so I can run avahi-daemon), and did this by running ```multipass launch -n vm01 --network enp3s0``` when, what should I see but: launch failed: The bridging feature is not implemented on this backend. OH NO!

By chance, I found a **[random Stack Overflow answer](https://askubuntu.com/a/1364507)**, which said:

Currently only the LXD driver supports the networks command on Linux.

So, letâ€™s make multipass on Ubuntu use LXD! (Be prepared for entering your password a few times!)

Firstly, we need to install LXD. Dead simple:

LXD ( [lÉ›ks'di:] ðŸ”ˆ) is a modern, secure and powerful system container and virtual machine manager. It provides a unified experience for running and managing full Linux systems inside containers or virtual machines.

```bash
sudo snap install lxd
lxd (5.21/stable) 5.21.1-d46c406 from Canonicalâœ“ installed
```

Next, we need to tell snap that itâ€™s allowed to connect LXD to multipass:

```bash
sudo snap connect multipass:lxd lxd
```

And lastly, we tell multipass to use lxd:

```bash
multipass set local.driver=lxd
```

```bash
# repsys11

```

Thank you Lord for every trial and problem you allow me to go through today.

## Step 1: Create a Bridge

The first step is to create a new bridge/switch with a static IP on your host. This is beyond the scope of Multipass but, as an example, here is how this can be achieved with NetworkManager (e.g. on Ubuntu Desktop):

```bash
sudo nmcli connection add type bridge con-name localbr ifname localbr \
    ipv4.method manual ipv4.addresses 10.1.0.126/22

#This will create a bridge named localbr with IP 10.1.0.126/22. You can see the new device and address with ip -c -br addr show dev localbr. This should show:

ip -c -br addr show dev localbr
localbr          DOWN           10.1.0.126/22
```

You can also run multipass networks to confirm the bridge is available for Multipass to connect to.

## Step 2: Launch an instance with a manual network

Next we launch an instance with an extra network in manual mode, connecting it to this bridge:

```bash
multipass launch --name test1 --network name=localbr,mode=manual,mac="52:54:00:4b:ab:cd"

multipass launch --name test3 --network name=localbr,mode=manual,mac="53:54:00:4b:ab:cd" 

```

You can also leave the MAC address unspecified (just --network name=localbr,mode=manual). If you do so, Multipass will generate a random MAC for you, but you will need to retrieve it in the next step.

## Step 3: Configure the extra interface

We now need to configure the manual network interface inside the instance. We can achieve that using Netplan. The following command plants the required Netplan configuration file in the instance:

```bash
$ multipass exec -n test1 -- sudo bash -c 'cat << EOF > /etc/netplan/10-custom.yaml
network:
    version: 2
    ethernets:
        extra0:
            dhcp4: no
            match:
                macaddress: "52:54:00:4b:ab:cd"
            addresses: [10.1.0.126/22]
EOF'
```

The IP address needs to be unique and in the same subnet as the bridge. The MAC address needs to match the extra interface inside the instance: either the one provided in step 2 or the one Multipass generated (you can find it with ip link).

If you want to set a different name for the interface, you can add a set-name property.

## Step 4: Apply the new configuration

We now tell netplan apply the new configuration inside the instance:

```bash
multipass exec -n test1 -- sudo netplan apply
# You may also use netplan try, to have the outcome reverted if something goes wrong.

```

## Step 5: Confirm that it works

You can confirm that the new IP is present in the instance with Multipass:

```bash
Name:           test1
State:          Running
IPv4:           10.182.32.10
                10.1.0.126
Release:        Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
Image hash:     08c7ba960c16 (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS)
CPU(s):         1
Load:           0.00 0.00 0.05
Disk usage:     1.2GiB out of 9.6GiB
Memory usage:   342.6MiB out of 945.6MiB
Mounts:         --

#The command above should show two IPs, the second of which is the one we just configured (10.1.0.126). You can use ping to confirm that it can be reached from the host:

ping 10.1.0.126
# Conversely, you can also ping from the instance to the host:

multipass exec -n test1 -- ping 10.1.0.126
```

I could ping from the test1 to the host but not to reports-alb

## Conclusion

You have now created a small internal network, local to your host, with Multipass instances that you can reach on the same IP across reboots. Instances still have the default NAT-ed network, which they can use to reach the outside world. You can combine this with other networks if you want to (e.g. for bridging).

thank you Father for allowing me enjoy my work no matter if I succeed or fail.  You can not fail if you do not give up and I am in control of if you succeed or not.
