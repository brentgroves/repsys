## **[ODBC Driver Manager](https://insightsoftware.com/blog/what-is-odbc/#:~:text=Open%20Database%20Connectivity%20(ODBC)%20is,based%20data%20access%20was%20born.)**

The ODBC Driver Manager loads and unloads ODBC drivers on behalf of an application. The Windows platform comes with a default Driver Manager, while non-windows platforms have the choice to use an open source ODBC Driver Manager like unixODBC and iODBC. The ODBC Driver Manager processes ODBC function calls, or passes them to an ODBC driver and resolves ODBC version conflicts.
