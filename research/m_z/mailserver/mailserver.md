# Linux Mail Server

## AI Overview

To set up a Linux mail server and verify it using DNS TXT records, you'll need to create and configure the necessary DNS records, including MX and TXT records, and then verify them using tools like dig or nslookup. [1, 2, 3]  
Steps: [3, 3, 4, 4]  

1. Set up your Linux mail server: [3, 3, 4]  
 • Install a mail server software like postfix, exim, or dovecot. [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]  
 • Configure the mail server with your domain name and other settings. [3, 3, 4, 4]  

2. Configure DNS records: [3, 3, 4, 4]  
 • MX Record: Create an MX record that points to your mail server's hostname (e.g., mail.yourdomain.com). This tells other mail servers where to send emails for your domain. [3, 3, 4, 4]  
 • A Record: Create an A record for your mail server's hostname (e.g., mail.yourdomain.com) that points to your mail server's IP address. [3, 3, 4, 4]  
 • TXT Records: [4, 4, 9, 9]  
  • SPF (Sender Policy Framework): Create an SPF TXT record to specify which servers are authorized to send mail on behalf of your domain. This helps prevent spam and phishing. [4, 4, 9, 9]  
  • DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail): Create a DKIM TXT record to verify that outgoing emails from your domain are actually sent by you and not forged. [4, 4, 10, 11, 12, 13]  
  • DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance): Create a DMARC TXT record to provide instructions to receiving mail servers on how to handle emails that don't pass DKIM or SPF checks. [4, 4, 14, 15]  

3. Verify DNS records: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]  
 • Use dig or nslookup to query your domain's DNS records and ensure that the MX, A, and TXT records are configured correctly. [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]  
 • For example, to check the MX records:

        dig MX yourdomain.com

To check the TXT records. [1, 16]  
        dig TXT yourdomain.com

• You can also use online DNS lookup tools to verify your DNS records. [2]  

1. Test email sending and receiving: [2, 3, 3]  
 • Send a test email from an external email address to your mail server. [3, 3]  
 • Test email sending from your mail server to an external email address. [3, 3]  

Example TXT records:
spf.
    example.com.  IN TXT "v=spf1 include:spf.yourdomain.com ~all"

• DKIM: (Replace the placeholder with your actual DKIM key) [17]  

    _domainkey.example.com. IN TXT "key=your_dkim_key_here"

DMARC.
    _dmarc.example.com.  IN TXT "v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:rua@example.com; ruf=mailto:ruf@example.com"
