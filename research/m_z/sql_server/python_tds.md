## Pytds - Microsoft SQL Server database adapter for Python

Pytds is the top to bottom pure Python TDS implementation, that means cross-platform, and no dependency on ADO or FreeTDS. It supports large parameters (>4000 characters), MARS, timezones, new date types (datetime2, date, time, datetimeoffset). Even though it is implemented in Python performance is comparable to ADO and FreeTDS bindings
