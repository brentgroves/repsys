# **[ID token claims reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/id-token-claims-reference)**

ID tokens are **[JSON web tokens](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token)** (JWT). The v1.0 and v2.0 ID tokens have differences in the information they carry. The version is based on the endpoint from where it was requested. While existing applications likely use the Azure AD v1.0 endpoint, new applications should use the v2.0 endpoint.

v1.0: <https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/authorize>
v2.0: <https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize>

All JWT claims listed in the following sections appear in both v1.0 and v2.0 tokens unless stated otherwise. ID tokens consist of a header, payload, and signature. The header and signature are used to verify the authenticity of the token, while the payload contains the information about the user requested by your client.

## Header claims

The following table shows header claims present in ID tokens.

| Claim | Format                | Description                                                                                                                              |
|-------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| typ   | String - always "JWT" | Indicates that the token is a JWT token.                                                                                                 |
| alg   | String                | Indicates the algorithm that was used to sign the token. For example: "RS256"                                                            |
| kid   | String                | Specifies the thumbprint for the public key that can be used to validate the token's signature. Emitted in both v1.0 and v2.0 ID tokens. |
| x5t   | String                | Functions the same (in use and value) as kid. x5t is a legacy claim emitted only in v1.0 ID tokens for compatibility purposes.           |

## Payload claims

The following table shows the claims that are in most ID tokens by default (except where noted). However, your app can use optional claims to request more claims in the ID token. Optional claims can range from the groups claim to information about the user's name.

| Claim              | Format                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|--------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| aud                | String, an App ID GUID     | Identifies the intended recipient of the token. In id_tokens, the audience is your app's Application ID, assigned to your app in the Azure portal. This value should be validated. The token should be rejected if it fails to match your app's Application ID.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| iss                | String, an issuer URI      | Identifies the issuer, or "authorization server" that constructs and returns the token. It also identifies the tenant for which the user was authenticated. If the token was issued by the v2.0 endpoint, the URI ends in /v2.0. The GUID that indicates that the user is a consumer user from a Microsoft account is 9188040d-6c67-4c5b-b112-36a304b66dad. Your app should use the GUID portion of the claim to restrict the set of tenants that can sign in to the app, if applicable.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| iat                | int, a Unix timestamp      | Indicates when the authentication for the token occurred.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| idp                | String, usually an STS URI | Records the identity provider that authenticated the subject of the token. This value is identical to the value of the issuer claim unless the user account isn't in the same tenant as the issuer - guests, for instance. If the claim isn't present, it means that the value of iss can be used instead. For personal accounts being used in an organizational context (for instance, a personal account invited to a tenant), the idp claim may be 'live.com' or an STS URI containing the Microsoft account tenant 9188040d-6c67-4c5b-b112-36a304b66dad.                                                                                                                         |
| nbf                | int, a Unix timestamp      | Identifies the time before which the JWT can't be accepted for processing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| exp                | int, a Unix timestamp      | Identifies the expiration time on or after which the JWT can't be accepted for processing. In certain circumstances, a resource may reject the token before this time. For example, if a change in authentication is required or a token revocation has been detected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| c_hash             | String                     | The code hash is included in ID tokens only when the ID token is issued with an OAuth 2.0 authorization code. It can be used to validate the authenticity of an authorization code. To understand how to do this validation, see the OpenID Connect specification. This claim isn't returned on ID tokens from the /token endpoint.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| at_hash            | String                     | The access token hash is included in ID tokens only when the ID token is issued from the /authorize endpoint with an OAuth 2.0 access token. It can be used to validate the authenticity of an access token. To understand how to do this validation, see the OpenID Connect specification. This claim isn't returned on ID tokens from the /token endpoint.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Should be ignored.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| preferred_username | String                     | The primary username that represents the user. It could be an email address, phone number, or a generic username without a specified format. Its value is mutable and might change over time. Since it's mutable, this value can't be used to make authorization decisions. It can be used for username hints and in human-readable UI as a username. The profile scope is required to receive this claim. Present only in v2.0 tokens.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| email              | String                     | Present by default for guest accounts that have an email address. Your app can request the email claim for managed users (from the same tenant as the resource) using the email optional claim. This value isn't guaranteed to be correct and is mutable over time. Never use it for authorization or to save data for a user. If you require an addressable email address in your app, request this data from the user directly by using this claim as a suggestion or prefill in your UX. On the v2.0 endpoint, your app can also request the email OpenID Connect scope - you don't need to request both the optional claim and the scope to get the claim.                       |
| name               | String                     | The name claim provides a human-readable value that identifies the subject of the token. The value isn't guaranteed to be unique, it can be changed, and should be used only for display purposes. The profile scope is required to receive this claim.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| nonce              | String                     | The nonce matches the parameter included in the original authorize request to the IDP. If it doesn't match, your application should reject the token.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| oid                | String, a GUID             | The immutable identifier for an object, in this case, a user account. This ID uniquely identifies the user across applications - two different applications signing in the same user receives the same value in the oid claim. Microsoft Graph returns this ID as the id property for a user account. Because the oid allows multiple apps to correlate users, the profile scope is required to receive this claim. If a single user exists in multiple tenants, the user contains a different object ID in each tenant - they're considered different accounts, even though the user logs into each account with the same credentials. The oid claim is a GUID and can't be reused. |

For JWTs as a distributed claim, for SAML as a new claim in place of the groups claim.  Example JWT Value: "groups":"src1" "_claim_sources: "src1" : { "endpoint" : "<https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{userID}/getMemberObjects>" }  For more info, see Groups overage claim.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## Use claims to reliably identify a user

When identifying a user, it's critical to use information that remains constant and unique across time. Legacy applications sometimes use fields like the email address, phone number, or UPN. All of these fields can change over time, and can also be reused over time. For example, when an employee changes their name, or an employee is given an email address that matches that of a previous, no longer present employee. Your application mustn't use human-readable data to identify a user - human readable generally means someone can read it, and want to change it. Instead, use the claims provided by the OIDC standard, or the extension claims provided by Microsoft - the sub and oid claims.

To correctly store information per-user, use sub or oid alone (which as GUIDs are unique), with tid used for routing or sharding if needed. If you need to share data across services, oid and tid is best as all apps get the same oid and tid claims for a user acting in a tenant. The sub claim is a pair-wise value that's unique. The value is based on a combination of the token recipient, tenant, and user. Two apps that request ID tokens for a user receive different sub claims, but the same oid claims for that user.

Guest scenarios, where a user is homed in one tenant, and authenticates in another, should treat the user as if they're a brand new user to the service. Your documents and privileges in one tenant shouldn't apply in another tenant. This restriction is important to prevent accidental data leakage across tenants, and enforcement of data lifecycles. Evicting a guest from a tenant should also remove their access to the data they created in that tenant.

## Groups overage claim

To ensure that the token size doesn't exceed HTTP header size limits, the number of object IDs that it includes in the groups claim is limited. If a user is a member of more groups than the overage limit (150 for SAML tokens, 200 for JWT tokens), the groups claim isn't included in the token. Instead, it includes an overage claim in the token that indicates to the application to query the Microsoft Graph API to retrieve the user's group membership.

```json
{
  ...
  "_claim_names": {
   "groups": "src1"
    },
    {
  "_claim_sources": {
    "src1": {
        "endpoint":"[Url to get this user's group membership from]"
        }
       }
     }
  ...
}
```

## **[ID tokens in the Microsoft identity platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/id-tokens)**

The authorization server issues ID tokens that contain claims that carry information about the user. They can be sent alongside or instead of an access token. Information in ID tokens enables the client to verify that a user is who they claim to be.

Third-party applications are intended to understand ID tokens. ID tokens shouldn't be used for authorization purposes. Access tokens are used for authorization. The claims provided by ID tokens can be used for UX inside your application, as keys in a database, and providing access to the client application. For more information about the claims used in an ID token, see the ID token claims reference. For more information about claims-based authorization, see Secure applications and APIs by validating claims.

## Token formats

There are two versions of ID tokens available in the Microsoft identity platform: v1.0 and v2.0. These versions determine the claims that are in the token. The v1.0 and v2.0 ID tokens have differences in the information they carry. The version is based on the endpoint from where it was requested. New applications should use the v2.0.

- v1.0: <https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/authorize>
- v2.0: <https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize>

## Token lifetime

By default, an ID token is valid for one hour - after one hour, the client must acquire a new ID token.

You can adjust the lifetime of an ID token to control how often the client application expires the application session, and how often it requires the user to authenticate again either silently or interactively. For more information, read **[Configurable token lifetimes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/configurable-token-lifetimes)**.

## Validate tokens

To validate an ID token, your client can check whether the token has been tampered with. It can also validate the issuer to ensure that the correct issuer has sent back the token. Because ID tokens are always a JWT token, many libraries exist to validate these tokens - you should use one of these libraries rather than doing it yourself. Only confidential clients should validate ID tokens. For more information, see **[Secure applications and APIs by validating claims](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/claims-validation)**.

Public applications (code running entirely on a device or network you don't control such as a user's browser or their home network) don't benefit from validating the ID token. In this instance, a malicious user can intercept and edit the keys used for validation of the token.

The following JWT claims should be validated in the ID token after validating the signature on the token. Your token validation library may also validate the following claims:

- Timestamps: the iat, nbf, and exp timestamps should all fall before or after the current time, as appropriate.
- Audience: the aud claim should match the app ID for your application.
- Nonce: the nonce claim in the payload must match the nonce parameter passed into the /authorize endpoint during the initial request.
