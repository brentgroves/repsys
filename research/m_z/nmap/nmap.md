The Nmap project tries to defy the stereotype of some open source software being poorly documented by providing a comprehensive set of documentation for installing and using Nmap. This page links to official Insecure.Org documentation, and generous contributions from other parties.

The primary documentation for using Nmap is the Nmap Reference Guide. This is also the basis for the Nmap man page (nroff version of nmap.1). It is regularly updated for each release and is meant to serve as a quick-reference to virtually all Nmap command-line arguments, but you can learn even more about Nmap by reading it straight through. The 18 sections include Brief Options Summary, Firewall/IDS Evasion and Spoofing, Timing and Performance, **[Port Scanning Techniques](https://nmap.org/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html)**, Usage Examples, and much more.
