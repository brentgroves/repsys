The TCP 3-Way Handshake is a fundamental process that establishes a reliable connection between two devices over a TCP/IP network. It involves three steps: SYN (Synchronize), SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge), and ACK (Acknowledge). During the handshake, the client and server exchange initial sequence numbers and confirm the connection establishment. In this article, we will discuss the TCP 3-Way Handshake Process.

## What is the TCP 3-Way Handshake?

The TCP 3-Way Handshake is a fundamental process used in the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to establish a reliable connection between a client and a server before data transmission begins. This handshake ensures that both parties are synchronized and ready for communication.
