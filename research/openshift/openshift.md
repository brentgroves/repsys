In summary, OpenStack and OpenShift serve different purposes in cloud computing and container orchestration. OpenStack is an IaaS platform that provides infrastructure management and virtualization capabilities, while OpenShift is a PaaS solution designed for container orchestration and application development.

When to use Red Hat OpenStack Platform
Red Hat OpenStack Platform continues to be the on-premise platform of choice for virtual machine management in a private cloud environment. It is used to manage storage, networking, bare-metal, and computing infrastructure, as well as VMs running applications that require guest operating systems.

In the telecommunications industry, OpenStack was integral to the rollouts of 3G and 4G/LTE, and many telcos continue to rely on it to maintain services associated with those protocols. Whatever your industry, if you have legacy applications that rely on virtualization, thereâ€™s almost certainly a use case relevant to your business that can be supported by Red Hat OpenStack Platform.
