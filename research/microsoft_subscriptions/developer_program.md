Qualifying Microsoft 365 Developer Program members can set up a Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription for use in building solutions independent of your production environment. The Microsoft 365 E5 developer sandbox subscription includes 25 user licenses and lasts for up to 90 days, depending on your activity. If you use your subscription for valid development activity, it will renew automatically. Commercial transactions, including purchasing paid services, are not currently supported.

Before you request a developer subscription, you must first join the Microsoft 365 Developer Program directly or through Visual Studio Professional or Enterprise (if you're a subscriber).

If you qualify for a Microsoft 365 E5 subscription through the developer program, the subscription set up flow will start automatically after you join the program. If you choose not to set up your subscription right away, the option to set up a subscription will be available on your Microsoft 365 Developer Program dashboard.

Qualifying members can choose to set up either an instant sandbox or a configurable sandbox.

 Note

Your Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription is for development purposes only and can be revoked if you use it for purposes other than development. For details, see the Microsoft 365 Developer Program Terms and Conditions.
Instant sandbox
If you choose an instant sandbox, you can cut your sandbox configuration time from days to seconds. The Microsoft 365 instant sandbox comes pre-provisioned with Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, Outlook, and Office. It also includes licenses for 24 test users plus one admin, and the latest Microsoft 365 apps for your PC and Mac, including Power Apps, Power BI, Enterprise Mobility + Security, Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection, and Microsoft Entra ID.

In addition, you get pre-installed sample data, including the new Teams sample data pack, as well as Microsoft Graph user, mail, and calendar data and SharePoint Framework sample data, which simulate a small corporate environment to help you build solutions across the Microsoft 365 platform. For details, see Developer sandbox sample data.

Set up your Microsoft 365 E5 sandbox subscription
To get a Microsoft 365 developer subscription:

On your profile page, choose Set up E5 subscription.

In the Set up your Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription dialog box, choose whether you want an instant sandbox or a configurable sandbox, and then choose Next.

If you're an active MCT with a Visual Studio Subscription, I recommend reaching out to Visual Studio Support. They specialize in addressing concerns regarding Visual Studio accounts and their associated benefits. You can submit an online request or contact them directly at 18007595474.

Otherwise, if you don't have a Visual Studio Subscription and are only joining for free, please note that as per the recent announcement on this Microsoft 365 Developer Program - Microsoft 365 Developer Blog, registration for the M365 DEV Subscription is currently closed. This affects customers without a PAID & Active VSS. Any updates regarding when this will resume or when this feature will become available again will be announced on the above-mentioned blog.
