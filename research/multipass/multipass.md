## Multipass Documentation

Multipass is a tool to generate cloud-style Ubuntu VMs quickly on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

It gives you a simple but powerful CLI that allows you to quickly access an Ubuntu command line or create your own local mini-cloud.

Local development and testing is a pain, but Multipass makes it easier by automating all of your setup and teardown. Multipass has a growing library of images that give you the ability to launch purpose-built VMs, or custom VMs youâ€™ve configured yourself through its powerful cloud-init interface.

Developers can use Multipass to prototype cloud deployments and to create fresh, customized Linux dev environments on any machine. Mac and Windows users can use Multipass as the quickest way to get an Ubuntu command line on their system. New Ubuntu users can use it as a sandbox to try new things without affecting their host machine, and without the need to dual boot.
