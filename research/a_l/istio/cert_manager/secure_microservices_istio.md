In this tutorial you will learn how to deploy and configure cert-manager on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and how to deploy an HTTPS web server and make it available on the Internet. You will learn how to configure cert-manager to get a signed certificate from Let's Encrypt, which will allow clients to connect to your HTTPS website securely. You will configure cert-manager to use the Let's Encrypt DNS-01 challenge protocol with Azure DNS, using workload identity federation to authenticate to Azure.
