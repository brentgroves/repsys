The CertificateRequest is a namespaced resource in cert-manager that is used to request X.509 certificates from an Issuer. The resource contains a base64 encoded string of a PEM encoded certificate request which is sent to the referenced issuer. A successful issuance will return a signed certificate, based on the certificate signing request. CertificateRequests are typically consumed and managed by controllers or other systems and should not be used by humans - unless specifically needed.

A simple CertificateRequest looks like the following:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: CertificateRequest
metadata:
  name: my-ca-cr
spec:

  ```

This CertificateRequest will make cert-manager attempt to request the Issuer ca-issuer in the default issuer group cert-manager.io, return a certificate based upon the certificate signing request. Other groups can be specified inside the issuerRef which will change the targeted issuer to other external, third party issuers you may have installed.

The resource also exposes the option for stating the certificate as CA, Key Usages, and requested validity duration.

All fields within the spec of the CertificateRequest, as well as any managed cert-manager annotations, are immutable and cannot be modified after creation.

A successful issuance of the certificate signing request will cause an update to the resource, setting the status with the signed certificate, the CA of the certificate (if available), and setting the Ready condition to True.

Whether issuance of the certificate signing request was successful or not, a retry of the issuance will not happen. It is the responsibility of some other controller to manage the logic and life cycle of CertificateRequests.
