## Check cert-manager API

First, make sure that **[cmctl is installed](https://cert-manager.io/v1.6-docs/usage/cmctl/#installation)**.

cmctl performs a dry-run certificate creation check against the Kubernetes cluster. If successful, the message The cert-manager API is ready is displayed.

```bash
$ cmctl check api
The cert-manager API is ready
```

The command can also be used to wait for the check to be successful. Here is an output example of running the command at the same time that cert-manager is being installed:

```bash
$ cmctl check api --wait=2m
Not ready: the cert-manager CRDs are not yet installed on the Kubernetes API server
Not ready: the cert-manager CRDs are not yet installed on the Kubernetes API server
