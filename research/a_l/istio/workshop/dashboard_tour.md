We will explore the different dashboards that we have enabled with Istio:

- **Grafana:** exposes monitoring metrics for services running within the mesh.
- **Tracing:** offers end to end tracing of http requests going through different layers and containers.
- **Kiali:** Kiali offers visibility and real time observability for the services running within the mesh including Istio components.
