Kubernetes has made it easier to manage containerized microservices at scale. However, you get a limited set of security features with Kubernetes. A key component of application security is the prevention of unauthorized access. Standards-based identity and access management (IAM) for user authentication, such as SAML, WS-Fed, or the OpenID Connect/OAuth2 standards have to be used to ensure secure access to the application. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) can also be implemented as an additional security measure.
