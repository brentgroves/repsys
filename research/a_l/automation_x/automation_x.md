## What's automationX and automationX sever

and application in HMI, SCADA. DCS
thank a lot

We don't know if there are any aX users that participate on this list. A few might here have looked at aX but to fully understand the product you really have to do a project with it.

automationX starts with a philosophy to leverage IT or large market computing equipment for industrial automation. The automationX software is designed to reliably serve the needs of automation and at the same time be hardware and time efficient.

The automationX software provides interfaces for operator/HMI (aXViewer) and interfaces engineering & maintenance (aXEditor). There is also a fully integrated "real-time" control engine. This engine along with a global database, replaces the function of DCS/PLC controllers in the IT or aXserver.

Each aXserver can handle 1000's of I/O. Some of the aXServers in the world are serving 6000-7000 real inputs and outputs (both analog loops and digital) with scan times as low as 20 mS on the server, lower on the integrated distributed controllers (aXController). To make best use of resources we typically scan at 200 ms.

The result is you can compress an entire DCS or HMI/PLC system into groups of IT servers & clients, save time and overall costs. It's a product well suited for third world countries that require an automation system to power the
much needed renovations in factories and infrastructure. aX has switch-on-the-fly language for international users.

aX runs in Linux and Windows and no-charge software is available through us to test out on real projects.

We'd be happy to answer more questions on IT-based industrial automation, our philosophies and automationX products.
