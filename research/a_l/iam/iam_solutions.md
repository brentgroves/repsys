## KeyCloak

KeyCloak is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) project that offers enterprise IAM solutions. Keycloak emphasizes proficient enterprise authorization solutions by providing:

- User Federation
- Strong authentication, and authorization
- Generation of password policies

KeyCloak offers multiple ways to authenticate users. Firstly, it offers Single-Sign On (SSO) which enables your users to login into different systems using one digital identity. It is efficient because it is lightweight, fast, and scalable. KeyCloak creates the login forms and manages the authentication and storing of user credentials.

Users find it hard to memorize and keep track of many passwords. To solve this problem KeyCloak allows users to authenticate using social media platforms such as Facebook and Google. On top of that, it supports standard protocols such as OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML.

To manage users, Keycloak has an admin console that offers control over user permission, services, user sessions, and managed applications. You can also connect your existing relational database to Keycloak if it has users in it.
