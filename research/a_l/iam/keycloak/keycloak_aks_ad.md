## Introduction

Integrating Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with Keycloak through Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) as an intermediary leverages Azure ADâ€™s support for OpenID Connect (OIDC) to handle authentication and authorization. This integration enhances security, streamlines user management, and simplifies the authentication process for users accessing the AKS cluster.

## Integrating Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with Keycloak through Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Use case

The integration of AKS with Keycloak using Azure AD is highly applicable in all these industries and beyond that prioritize security, scalability, and efficient user management, making it a best practice for organizations leveraging cloud-based Kubernetes environments.

- Financial Services: Securely manage and authenticate thousands of users accessing sensitive financial data and applications hosted on Kubernetes clusters.
- Healthcare: Protect patient data and ensure compliance with healthcare regulations while providing medical staff secure access to applications.
- E-commerce: Manage a large user base accessing e-commerce platforms and ensure secure transactions and user data protection.
- Technology and Software Development: Provide developers with secure access to development environments and resources hosted on Kubernetes clusters.
- Education: Manage access to educational resources and applications for students, faculty, and staff in a secure manner.
