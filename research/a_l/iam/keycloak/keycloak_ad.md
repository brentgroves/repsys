In this post, Iâ€™ll discuss integrating Keycloak with Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD). This topic emerged from a real-world necessity at my job, where we needed to bridge Keycloak with AD for a client using Azure AD. Additionally, my struggles to find detailed guidance on this setup inspired me to share my findings.

I made this post in 2021 when I needed to do this integration. Maybe something has changed in the Azure cloud since then

# Register an app in Azure Active Directory
