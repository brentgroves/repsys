**JWT token vs oauth token:** JWT defines a token format while OAuth deals in defining authorization protocols. JWT is simple and easy to learn from the initial stage while OAuth is complex. OAuth uses both client-side and server-side storage while JWT must use only client-side storage. JWT has limited scope and use cases.
