As we move towards a zero-trust mindset, the limitation of coarse-grained security measures like the traditional RBAC system become clear. An essential part of the shift to zero trust that often goes undiscussed is the move from coarse-grained to fine-grained security. Fine-grained authorization addresses this by basing access on attributes like user roles, actions, and even context like time or location, and such detailed access control is vital for contemporary applications.
