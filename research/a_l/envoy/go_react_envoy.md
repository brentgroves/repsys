In today’s blog post, we’ll explore the process of creating a GRPC service using Go and consuming it in a React app with the help of Envoy proxy. GRPC is a high-performance, language-agnostic remote procedure call (RPC) framework, and when combined with Go and Envoy, it becomes a powerful tool for building distributed systems. We’ll walk through each step of the process, from setting up the GRPC service in Go to creating a React app that communicates with it via Envoy.
