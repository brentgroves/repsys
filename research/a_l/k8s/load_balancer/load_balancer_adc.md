## Overview

In the current era, demanding digital transformations has led to several transforming initiatives like mobility and collaborative mobile workspaces. The new standards in the digital strategy of businesses is leveraging the cloud technology and enhancing application infrastructure to gain better profitability while eliminating data-breach risks. As applications play a decisive role in this regard, it is important to ensure their peak performance, which is critically dependent on traffic management.

Adoption of appropriate networking technologies gains greater efficiency and competitive advantages for the organizations. For the ‘intelligent’ traffic management and the best user experience, the conventional load balancing techniques are not substantial. Now the need is for an advanced solution- Application Delivery Controller.

## 1.2 What is Application Delivery?

As the name suggests, the Application Delivery Controller delivers the application services and controls the interactions between clients and the application servers. The term controller, in this regard, is for the functional management of the data flow between computing systems and application services. This optimizes the application performance, availability, and strengthens the security level.

A **computing system** is a group of devices and programs that work together to input, process, store, and output data and information. Computing systems can range in size from simple sensors and hardware components to entire data centers.

Application delivery controller is a computer network device, placed in the DMZ, a zone between the outer firewall and a web farm. It optimizes and manages the connection of application servers with client machines.

In computer security, a **[DMZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_(computing))** or demilitarized zone (sometimes referred to as a perimeter network or screened subnet) is a physical or logical subnetwork that contains and exposes an organization's external-facing services to an untrusted, usually larger, network such as the Internet. The purpose of a DMZ is to add an additional layer of security to an organization's local area network (LAN): an external network node can access only what is exposed in the DMZ, while the rest of the organization's network is protected behind a firewall.[1] The DMZ functions as a small, isolated network positioned between the Internet and the private network.[2]

This is not to be confused with a DMZ host, a feature present in some home routers which frequently differs greatly from an ordinary

Conventionally the ADCs have been a physical hardware but now software defined ADCs are also becoming common.
In addition to the conventional load balancing capabilities, ADCs can perform application access management, server health checks, SSL offload, TCP reuse, and RAM caching. Also, it possesses proxy and reverse proxy capabilities, web application firewalls (WAF), DNS application firewalls (DAF), and many others to count.

With all these features, ADCs ensure the most optimized application performance, eliminating the downtime, and making the applications highly available and secure.
