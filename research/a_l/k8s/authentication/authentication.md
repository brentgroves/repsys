Details of Kubernetes authorization mechanisms and supported authorization modes.
Kubernetes authorization takes place following **[authentication](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/)**. Usually, a client making a request must be authenticated (logged in) before its request can be allowed; however, Kubernetes also allows anonymous requests in some circumstances.

For an overview of how authorization fits into the wider context of API access control, read **[Controlling Access to the Kubernetes API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/controlling-access/)**.
