## Virtual IPs and Service Proxies

Every node in a Kubernetes cluster runs a kube-proxy (unless you have deployed your own alternative component in place of kube-proxy).

The kube-proxy component is responsible for implementing a virtual IP mechanism for Services of type other than ExternalName. Each instance of kube-proxy watches the Kubernetes control plane for the addition and removal of Service and EndpointSlice objects. For each Service, kube-proxy calls appropriate APIs (depending on the kube-proxy mode) to configure the node to capture traffic to the Service's clusterIP and port, and redirect that traffic to one of the Service's endpoints (usually a Pod, but possibly an arbitrary user-provided IP address). A control loop ensures that the rules on each node are reliably synchronized with the Service and EndpointSlice state as indicated by the API server.

## Virtual IP mechanism for Services, using iptables mode

A question that pops up every now and then is why Kubernetes relies on proxying to forward inbound traffic to backends. What about other approaches? For example, would it be possible to configure DNS records that have multiple A values (or AAAA for IPv6), and rely on round-robin name resolution?

There are a few reasons for using proxying for Services:

- There is a long history of DNS implementations not respecting record TTLs, and caching the results of name lookups after they should have expired.
- Some apps do DNS lookups only once and cache the results indefinitely.
- Even if apps and libraries did proper re-resolution, the low or zero TTLs on the DNS records could impose a high load on DNS that then becomes difficult to manage.

Later in this page you can read about how various kube-proxy implementations work. Overall, you should note that, when running kube-proxy, kernel level rules may be modified (for example, iptables rules might get created), which won't get cleaned up, in some cases until you reboot. Thus, running kube-proxy is something that should only be done by an administrator which understands the consequences of having a low level, privileged network proxying service on a computer. Although the kube-proxy executable supports a cleanup function, this function is not an official feature and thus is only available to use as-is.

Some of the details in this reference refer to an example: the backend Pods for a stateless image-processing workloads, running with three replicas. Those replicas are fungibleâ€”frontends do not care which backend they use. While the actual Pods that compose the backend set may change, the frontend clients should not need to be aware of that, nor should they need to keep track of the set of backends themselves.

## Proxy modes

The kube-proxy starts up in different modes, which are determined by its configuration.

On Linux nodes, the available modes for kube-proxy are:

**iptables**\
A mode where the kube-proxy configures packet forwarding rules using iptables.

**ipvs**\
a mode where the kube-proxy configures packet forwarding rules using ipvs.

**nftables**\
a mode where the kube-proxy configures packet forwarding rules using nftables.

There is only one mode available for kube-proxy on Windows:

**kernelspace**\
a mode where the kube-proxy configures packet forwarding rules in the Windows kernel
