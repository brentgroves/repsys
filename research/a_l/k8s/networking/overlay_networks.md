An overlay network is a virtual or logical network that is created on top of an existing physical network. The internet, which connects many nodes via circuit switching, is an example of an overlay network. An overlay network is any virtual layer on top of physical network infrastructure.

**What is an overlay network?**

An overlay network is a virtual or logical network that is created on top of an existing physical network. The internet, which connects many nodes via circuit switching, is an example of an overlay network.

An overlay network is any virtual layer on top of physical network infrastructure. This may be as simple as a virtual local area network (VLAN) but typically refers to more complex virtual layers from software-defined networking (SDN) or a software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN).

The overlay creates a new layer where traffic can be programmatically directed through new virtual network routes or paths instead of requiring physical links. Overlays enable administrators to define and manage traffic flows, irrespective of the underlying physical infrastructure.
