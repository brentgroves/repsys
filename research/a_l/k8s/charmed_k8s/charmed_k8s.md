# **[What is Charmed Kubernetes?](https://www.armosec.io/glossary/charmed-kubernetes/)**

Charmed Kubernetes offers Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) models to build, deploy, and run multiple applications and services on Kubernetes clusters. The service is built on Ubuntu and carried out using Juju Charms, a set of tools that enable lifecycle management of all clusters in an enterprise. Charms is a model-driven approach DevOps engineers can leverage to build applications from the ground up and streamline multi-cloud cluster management.
