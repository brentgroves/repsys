A curated list of awesome diagramming tools available for software engineering teams. Feel free to contribute to this on-going list.

## When diagrams are useful?

Diagrams are faster and compact way for knowledge transfer. It's much easier to communicate a system architecture with a diagram compared to writing an essay on it.

Following are the major categories diagrams used by most efficient software engineering teams (based on more than 30 interviews with engineers working in startups and big tech):

- System Architecture Diagram - to visualize high-level structure of a software system and interactions between difference components
- Sequence Diagram - to visualize data flow between different components in a sequential order
- Database Schema Diagram - to visualize data models and relations between entities (ER Diagrams)
- Gantt Chart - used for project planning and timeline estimation

## General Purpose (flexible for all kinds of diagrams)
