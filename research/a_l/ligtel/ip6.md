# Request a block of IPv6 addresses

## June 6

- Ask Ligtel ip6 address block

IPv6 rangeblocks
IPv6 addresses are each 128 bits long. Because each digit in an IPv6 address can have 16 different values (from 0 to 15), each digit represents the overall value of 4 bits (one nibble), with 32 digits total. As with IPv4, CIDR notation describes ranges in terms of a common prefix of bits. For example 2001:db8::/32 means that the range described has the first 32 bits set to the binary digits 00100000000000010000110110101000. Also like IPv4, MediaWiki implements IPv6 rangeblocks using CIDR notation.
