# key unlock

To unlock a BitLocker-encrypted drive or PC, you typically need a PIN, password, startup key, or the recovery key, which is a 48-digit code. The process involves providing the required authentication through the BitLocker Recovery console (for a locked operating system) or by right-clicking the drive in File Explorer and selecting "Unlock Drive" (for other drives). The recovery key is essential if you forget your PIN or password and can often be found by signing into your Microsoft account at aka.ms/myrecoverykey or your work/school account at aka.ms/aadrecoverykey.
