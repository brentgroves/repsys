# does windows 11 require secure boot

While Secure Boot is required for installing Windows 11, it is not required to be enabled for the operating system to function. Windows 11 needs to detect that Secure Boot is capable (i.e., that the system's UEFI/BIOS supports it), but it can still run if Secure Boot is turned off.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:
**Installation Requirement:** To install Windows 11, your PC needs to have Secure Boot enabled in the UEFI/BIOS settings or be at least capable of supporting it.
**Functionality Requirement:** Once installed, Windows 11 can run even if Secure Boot is disabled. However, it is recommended to keep it enabled for enhanced security.
**Security Feature:** Secure Boot helps protect your system from malware that attempts to interfere with the boot process, like rootkits.
**Troubleshooting:** If you encounter issues during installation or while running Windows 11 with Secure Boot enabled, you might need to check your BIOS settings or explore troubleshooting options.
