Imagine web application development services wherein every part functions on its own yet when together, they form a strong, scalable system. This is the core of microservices architecture, a cutting-edge strategy that lets your application scale with your business.

With its increasing popularity, microservices architecture is quickly becoming the preferred choice for businesses looking to develop and scale quickly. Your application will be delivered more quickly and with more flexibility if it is divided up into smaller, self-contained services that can all be created, launched, and scaled separately.

O'Reilly reports that 77% of firms are either planning to adopt this architecture or have already done so, while 92% of organizations claim quicker deployment times and better team productivity using microservices. Understanding microservices is essential for CEOs, CTOs, and project managers who are focused on creating dependable, scalable web applications.

We'll go over the basis of microservices architecture, the advantages of creating scalable web applications, and the salient characteristics that establish microservices as a crucial approach for modern application development in this blog.

## What does a scalable web application mean?

A scalable web application is designed to accommodate the sudden increase in the number of users and load, irrespective of whether it is a gradual or abrupt peak, without disrupting end-user experience and activities.

Scaling web applications will help you to grow and handle the requests per minute more efficiently. Before scaling web applications, there are some factors that you need to consider like scaling metrics and costs of scaling. These factors are highly determinal in ensuring the feasibility of scaling web applications.

Designed using modern technologies and frameworks like microservices architecture, **[PWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app)**, caching and cloud storage, a scaling web application ensures that performance remains unchanged throughout the use.
