## What is MVVM?

Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) is a design pattern that helps you separate your application logic from the user interface. It's a different way to think about your code, but it can make your applications easier to build and test. The Model-View-ViewModel pattern is an architectural software design pattern in which the model represents the data, the view is what the user sees and interacts with, and the viewmodel acts as a mediator between the model and view.
