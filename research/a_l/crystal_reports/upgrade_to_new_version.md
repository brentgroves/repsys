Resolution
Reports created in older versions of Crystal Reports can be open, edited and refreshed in the latest version of Crystal Reports.

For example: Crystal Reports 20202 can open, read and refresh a report that was originally created in Crystal Reports XI

In more details: Reports created in Crystal Reports are backward compatible. This means, later version of Crystal Reports can open, edit and refresh a report that was originally created in Crystal Reports version 7 and later.

Crystal Reports XI and higher, cannot report off Crystal Dictionaries, Queries or Info Views.
For more details, see the SAP Knowledge Base Article 1219071

Reports based off the SAP BW Query Driver are not supported in Crystal Reports 2011 and higher.
For more details, see the SAP Knowledge Base Article 1716438

Reports created in later versions of Crystal Reports can be opened and saved in earlier versions of Crystal Reports, however, functions exclusive to the latest versions will not be available in the lower versions.

For example: Dynamic Parameter did not exist in Crystal Reports 9, therefore if you create a dynamic parameter in Crystal Reports 2013, and open the report in Crystal Reports 9,  then the parameter will not be dynamic. It will be static, since the functionality did not exist in that version.

WARNING: We strongly recommend that you create backup copies of reports created in Crystal Reports 8.5 and earlier, prior to saving them as Crystal Reports 9, and higher, because this action cannot be reversed.
See Also
Crystal Reports 9 and higher support Unicode. Earlier versions of Crystal Reports do not support Unicode. Therefore, once a report has been saved in Crystal Reports 9 or higher, the report cannot be opened in Crystal Reports 8.5 or earlier.
