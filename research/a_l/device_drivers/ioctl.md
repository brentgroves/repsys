IOCTL in Linux (I/O Control) â€“ Linux Device Driver Tutorial Part 8

This article provides source code examples for both the driver and the userspace application to demonstrate the usage of IOCTL in Linux device drivers. Overall, the article serves as a tutorial for understanding and implementing IOCTL in Linux device drivers to enable communication between userspace and kernel space.

This article is a continuation of the Series on Linux Device Drivers and carries the discussion on Linux device drivers and their implementation. The aim of this series is to provide easy and practical examples that anyone can understand.

In our previous tutorial, we learned simple Linux Device Driver Programming. Now, we will just improve that device driver by adding some features.
