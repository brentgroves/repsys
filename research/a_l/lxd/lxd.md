LXD ( [lÉ›ks'di:] ðŸ”ˆ) is a modern, secure and powerful system container and virtual machine manager. It provides a unified experience for running and managing full Linux systems inside containers or virtual machines.

## **[LXD vs. LXC](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/lxd/en/latest/explanation/lxd_lxc/)**

LXD and LXC are two distinct implementations of Linux containers.

LXC is a low-level user space interface for the Linux kernel containment features. It consists of tools (lxc-* commands), templates, and library and language bindings.

LXD is a more intuitive and user-friendly tool aimed at making it easy to work with Linux containers. It is an alternative to LXCâ€™s tools and distribution template system, with the added features that come from being controllable over the network. Under the hood, LXD uses LXC to create and manage the containers.
