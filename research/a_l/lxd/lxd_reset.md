# **[lxd reset](https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/lxd-4-1-reset-lxd-init/8210)**

I unsucessfuly tried to reset lxd after making an error on the lxd init process. How can I do that ?

What do you want changed?

lxd init is only a convenient way to do a bunch of commands at once:

lxc config set
lxc network create
lxc storage create
lxc profile device add
So itâ€™s often far easier to undo and reconfigure the bits you need than wipe everything clean and run init again.

```bash
lxc network show lxdbr0

name: lxdbr0
description: ""
type: bridge
managed: true
status: Created
config:
  ipv4.address: 10.223.105.1/24
  ipv4.nat: "true"
  ipv6.address: fd42:9d25:8ccd:5ac8::1/64
  ipv6.nat: "true"
used_by:
- /1.0/profiles/default
locations:
- none
```

Also, can you show:

ps fauxww
iptables -L -n -v
If I had to guess, your lxd init went fine but you have docker or firewalld messing with your firewall blocking DHCP from your container.

## Remove

You can remove LXD (including all container and VM instances!) by running:

```bash
sudo snap remove lxd --purge
```

You can add a new dir storage pool using:

lxc storage add mypool dir
This will use the /var/lib/lxd/storage-pools/mypool directory for instances.
If you want to use a different directory add the source=/path/to/dir argument to the command above.

Then you can create instances using that pool using:

lxc launch ... -s mypool
If you want that pool to be the default pool for new instances you can modify the default profile using:

lxc profile device set default root pool=mypool
