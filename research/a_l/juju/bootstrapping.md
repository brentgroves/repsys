# **[Bootstrapping](https://juju.is/docs/juju/bootstrapping)**

In Juju, bootstrapping refers to the process whereby a **[Juju client](./juju_client.md)** creates a **[controller](./controller.md)** on a specific cloud.

A controller is needed to perform any further Juju operations, such as deploying an application.
