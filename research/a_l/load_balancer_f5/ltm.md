# Application Traffic Management

BIG-IP LTM includes static and dynamic load balancing to eliminate single points of
failure. Application proxies give you protocol awareness to control traffic for your most
important applications. BIG-IP LTM also tracks the dynamic performance levels of servers
in a group, ensuring that your applications are not just always on, but also are easier to
scale and manage.

## Secure Application Delivery

BIG-IP LTM delivers industry-leading SSL performance and visibility for inbound and
outbound traffic, so you can cost-effectively protect your entire user experience by
encrypting everything from the client to the server. It also defends against potentially
crippling DDoS attacks and provides ICAP services for integration with data loss protection
and virus protection.

## Application Delivery Optimization

BIG-IP LTM scales dramatically, improving page load times and the user experience
with HTTP/2, intelligent caching, extensive connection optimization and management,
compression, RAMCache performance, F5 TCP Express™, and F5 OneConnect™. It also
makes real-time protocol and traffic-management decisions based on application and server
conditions, enables rules customization and programmability, and TCP and content offloading.

## Application Visibility and Monitoring

Monitor exactly how your application is performing for real users based on application
response times, network conditions, and user context. F5 Analytics captures applicationspecific statistics, such as URL, throughput, and server latency, reported at different levels
of the service. BIG-IP LTM makes it simple to integrate with your existing tools using industry
standards such as sFlow, SNMP, and syslog.

## IoT Protocol Visibility

BIG-IP LTM enables support of IoT clients, publishing useful information to the MQTT Brokers
(servers) through the MQTT protocol. The MQTT Brokers then send information to all the
subscribers of this information and MQTT support allows BIG-IP LTM to leverage MQTT traffic
load balancing for customers’ IoT clients.
