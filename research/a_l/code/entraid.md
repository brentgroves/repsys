# **[Quickstart: Get started with the Microsoft Entra External ID extension for Visual Studio Code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/customers/visual-studio-code-extension)**

Integrating authentication into your consumer and business customer applications is essential for securing resources and customer data. The Microsoft Entra External ID extension for Visual Studio Code lets you quickly create external tenants, configure sign-in experiences for external users, and set up an External ID sample, all directly within Visual Studio Code. Using the extension walkthrough, you can learn how to set up a customized, branded sign-in experience for external users of your application and bootstrap your projects with preconfigured sample applications.

This extension provides a basic setup that automatically creates a tenant for applications and prepares it for users. It also streamlines your workflow by automatically populating values such as application IDs into your configuration file for a smoother setup process.

External ID is a service that can be added to an Azure subscription. If you already have one, you can easily include External ID. Otherwise, set up a free trial of Microsoft Entra External ID within Visual Studio Code and start by configuring a sample app.
