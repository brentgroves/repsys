Visual Studio Code Remote Development Extension Pack
The Remote Development extension pack allows you to open any folder in a container, on a remote machine, or in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and take advantage of VS Code's full feature set. Since this lets you set up a full-time development environment anywhere, you can:

Develop on the same operating system you deploy to or use larger, faster, or more specialized hardware than your local machine.
Quickly swap between different, separate development environments and make updates without worrying about impacting your local machine.
Help new team members / contributors get productive quickly with easily spun up, consistent development containers.
Take advantage of a Linux based tool-chain right from the comfort of Windows from a full-featured development tool.
No source code needs to be on your local machine to gain these benefits since Remote Development runs commands and extensions directly on the remote machine.

This Remote Development extension pack includes four extensions:

Remote - SSH - Work with source code in any location by opening folders on a remote machine/VM using SSH. Supports x86_64, ARMv7l (AArch32), and ARMv8l (AArch64) glibc-based Linux, Windows 10/Server (1803+), and macOS 10.14+ (Mojave) SSH hosts.
Remote - Tunnels - Work with source code in any location by opening folders on a remote machine/VM using a VS Code Tunnel (rather than SSH).
Dev Containers - Work with a separate toolchain or container based application by opening any folder mounted into or inside a container.
WSL - Get a Linux-powered development experience from the comfort of Windows by opening any folder in the Windows Subsystem for Linux.
