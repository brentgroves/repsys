## Ingress controllers

When managing application traffic, Ingress controllers provide advanced capabilities by operating at layer 7. They can route HTTP traffic to different applications based on the inbound URL, allowing for more intelligent and flexible traffic distribution rules. For example, an ingress controller can direct traffic to different microservices depending on the URL path, enhancing the efficiency and organization of your services.

On the other hand, a LoadBalancer-type Service, when created, sets up an underlying Azure load balancer resource. This load balancer works at layer 4, distributing traffic to the pods in your Service on a specified port. However, layer 4 services are unaware of the actual applications and can't implement these types of complex routing rules.

Understanding the distinction between these two approaches helps in selecting the right tool for your traffic management needs.
