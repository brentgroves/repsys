# **[Azure Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/)**

Scope
Azure is itself a multitenant service, and some of our guidance is based on our experience with running large multitenant solutions. However, the focus of this series is on helping you build your own multitenant services, while harnessing the power of the Azure platform.

Additionally, when you design a solution, there are many areas you need to consider. The content in this section is specific to how you design for multitenancy. We don't cover all of the features of the Azure services, or all of the architectural design considerations for every application. You should read this guide in conjunction with the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework and the documentation for each Azure service that you use.

## Intended audience

The guidance provided in this series is applicable to anyone building a multitenant application in Azure. The audience also includes anybody who is building SaaS products, such as independent software vendors (ISVs) and startups, whether those SaaS products are targeted for businesses or consumers. It also includes anyone building a product or platform that's intended to be used by multiple customers or tenants.

Some of the content in this series is designed to be useful for technical decision-makers, like chief technology officers (CTOs) and architects, and anyone designing or implementing a multitenant solution on Microsoft Azure. Other content is more technically focused and is targeted at solution architects and engineers who implement a multitenant solution.
