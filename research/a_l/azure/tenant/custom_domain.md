Microsoft Entra tenants come with an initial domain name like, domainname.onmicrosoft.com. You can't change or delete the initial domain name, but you can add your organization's DNS name as a custom domain and set it as the primary domain. By adding your domain name, you can add user names that are familiar to your users, such as <alain@contoso.com>.
