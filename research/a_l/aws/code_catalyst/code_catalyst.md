# **[What is Amazon CodeCatalyst?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/latest/userguide/welcome.html)**

Amazon CodeCatalyst is an integrated service for software development teams adopting continuous integration and deployment practices into their software development process. CodeCatalyst puts the tools you need all in one place. You can plan work, collaborate on code, and build, test, and deploy applications with continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) tools. You can also integrate AWS resources with your projects by connecting your AWS accounts to your CodeCatalyst space. By managing all of the stages and aspects of your application lifecycle in one tool, you can deliver software quickly and confidently.

In CodeCatalyst, you create a space to represent your company, department, or group, and then you create projects that contain the resources needed to support your development teams and tasks. CodeCatalyst resources are structured inside projects that live inside spaces. To help teams get started quickly, CodeCatalyst provides language- or tool-based project blueprints. When you create a project from a project blueprint, the project comes with resources such as a source repository with sample code, build scripts, deployment actions, virtual servers or serverless resources, and more.

## What can I do with CodeCatalyst?

You and your development team can use CodeCatalyst to carry out each aspect of software development, from planning your work to deploying your applications. You can use CodeCatalyst to:

- Iterate and collaborate on code – Work collaboratively with your team on code with branches, merges, pull requests, and comments in your source code repositories. Create Dev Environments to work on code quickly without having to clone or set up connections to repositories.

- Build, test, and deploy your application with workflows – Configure workflows with build, test, and deploy actions to handle the continuous integration and delivery of your applications. You can either start workflows manually or configure them to start automatically based on events such as code pushes or creating or closing pull requests.

- Prioritize your team's work with issue tracking – Use issues to create backlogs and monitor the status of in-progress tasks with boards. Creating and maintaining a healthy backlog of items for your team to work on is an important part of developing software.

- Set up monitoring and notifications – Monitor team activity and resource status, and configure notifications to stay up to date with important changes.
