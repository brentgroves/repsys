The GDB developer's GNU Debugger tutorial, Part 1: Getting started with the debugger

This article is the first in a series demonstrating how to use the GNU Debugger (GDB) effectively to debug applications in C and C++. If you have limited or no experience using GDB, this series will teach you how to debug your code more efficiently. If you are already a seasoned professional using GDB, perhaps you will discover something you haven't seen before.

In addition to providing developer tips and tricks for many GDB commands, future articles will also cover topics such as debugging optimized code, offline debugging (core files), and server-based sessions (aka gdbserver, used in container debugging).
