A processor cache miss occurs when a processor's cache cannot find the data it needs, and must retrieve it from a slower storage location. Caches are smaller, faster types of computer memory that store copies of data and instructions that are frequently accessed. They act as a buffer between the processor and the main memory (RAM), which is slower. When a processor needs data, it first checks the cache, and if the data is found, it's called a cache hit. If the data isn't found, the processor must retrieve it from the main memory, which is slower, and this is called a cache miss
