# **[What's the Difference Between Hadoop and Spark?](https://aws.amazon.com/compare/the-difference-between-hadoop-vs-spark/)**

Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark are two open-source frameworks you can use to manage and process large volumes of data for analytics. Organizations must process data at scale and speed to gain real-time insights for business intelligence. Apache Hadoop allows you to cluster multiple computers to analyze massive datasets in parallel more quickly. Apache Spark uses in-memory caching and optimized query execution for fast analytic queries against data of any size. Spark is a more advanced technology than Hadoop, as Spark uses artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) in data processing. However, many companies use Spark and Hadoop together to meet their data analytics goals.
