# **[Delta Tables 101: A Comprehensive Overview (2025)](https://www.chaosgenius.io/blog/delta-table/)**

**[Data lakes](https://www.chaosgenius.io/blog/databricks-delta-lake/#what-is-data-lake)** provide a flexible and scalable solution for storing vast amounts of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data in its raw format. However, managing data lakes can be challenging due to issues with data reliability, consistency, data silos, and the inability to track data changes and recover from errors. Delta Lake, an open source storage layer, addresses these challenges by introducing a transactional storage layer on top of your data lake, enabling ACID transactions, data versioning, schema enforcement, and scalable metadata handling. But Delta Lake is just the framework/foundation; to really get the most out of your data, you need Delta Tables. These are like traditional tables but on steroidsâ€”optimized for large-scale analysis and capable of maintaining data consistency even as schemas evolve. They offer features like ACID transactions, data versioning (aka "time travel"), strict schema enforcement, and performance optimizations, enabling you to work with your data in ways that traditional table formats cannot.

In this article, we will cover everything you need to know about Databricks Delta Tables, exploring their architecture, features, and capabilities. On top of that, we will also guide you through the process of getting started with Delta Tables, covering everything from creating and loading data to querying, updating, and optimizing your tables. And then, we will discuss best practices, performance considerations, and real-world use cases of Delta Tables.
