## 01. What is Process Capability Analysis?

A process capability study uses data from an initial run of parts to predict whether a manufacturing process can repeatably produce parts that meet specifications.

Think of it as being similar to a forecast. You will take some historical data, and extrapolate out to the future to answer the question "can I rely on this process to deliver good parts?".

Your customers may require a process capability study as part of a PPAP. They will do this to ensure that your manufacturing processes are capable of consistently producing good parts.

## 02. The Basic Concept

When the manufacturing process is being defined, your goal is to ensure that the parts produced fall within the Upper and Lower Specification Limits (USL, LSL). Process Capability measures how consistently a manufacturing process can produce parts within specifications.

The basic idea is very simple. You want your manufacturing process to:

(1) be centered over the Nominal desired by the design engineer, and

(2) with a spread narrower than the specification width.

Cp measures whether the process spread is narrower than the specification width

Cpk measures both the centering of the process as well as the spread of the process relative to the specification width
