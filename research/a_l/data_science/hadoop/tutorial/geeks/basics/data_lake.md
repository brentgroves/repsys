Data lake definition
This introductory guide explores the many benefits and use cases of a data lake. Learn what a data lake is, why it matters, and discover the difference between data lakes and data warehouses. But first, let's define data lake as a term.

A data lake is a centralized repository that ingests and stores large volumes of data in its original form. The data can then be processed and used as a basis for a variety of analytic needs. Due to its open, scalable architecture, a data lake can accommodate all types of data from any source, from structured (database tables, Excel sheets) to semi-structured (XML files, webpages) to unstructured (images, audio files, tweets), all without sacrificing fidelity. The data files are typically stored in staged zones—raw, cleansed, and curated—so that different types of users may use the data in its various forms to meet their needs. Data lakes provide core data consistency across a variety of applications, powering big data analytics, machine learning, predictive analytics, and other forms of intelligent action.

## Why are data lakes important for businesses?

Today's highly connected, insights-driven world would not be possible without the advent of data lake solutions. That's because organizations rely on comprehensive data lakes platforms, such as Azure Data Lake, to keep raw data consolidated, integrated, secure, and accessible. Scalable storage tools like Azure Data Lake Storage can hold and protect data in one central place, eliminating silos at an optimal cost. This lays the foundation for users to perform a wide variety of workload categories, such as big data processing, SQL queries, text mining, streaming analytics, and machine learning. The data can then be used to feed upstream data visualization and ad-hoc reporting needs. A modern, end-to-end data platform like Azure Synapse Analytics addresses the complete needs of a big data architecture centered around the data lake.

## Data lake use cases

With a well-architected solution, the potential for innovation is endless. Here are just a few examples of how organizations across a range of industries use data lake platforms to optimize their growth:

Streaming media. Subscription-based streaming companies collect and process insights on customer behavior, which they may use to improve their recommendation algorithm.

Finance. Investment firms use the most up-to-date market data, which is collected and stored in real time, to efficiently manage portfolio risks.

Healthcare. Healthcare organizations rely on big data to improve the quality of care for patients. Hospitals use vast amounts of historical data to streamline patient pathways, resulting in better outcomes and reduced cost of care.

Omnichannel retailer. Retailers use data lakes to capture and consolidate data that's coming in from multiple touchpoints, including mobile, social, chat, word-of-mouth, and in person.

IoT. Hardware sensors generate enormous amounts of semi-structured to unstructured data on the surrounding physical world. Data lakes provide a central repository for this information to live in for future analysis.

Digital supply chain. Data lakes help manufacturers consolidate disparate warehousing data, including EDI systems, XML, and JSONs.

Sales. Data scientists and sales engineers often build predictive models to help determine customer behavior and reduce overall churn.

## Data lake vs. data warehouse

Now you know what a data lake is, why it matters, and how it's used across a variety of organizations. But what's the difference between a data lake and a data warehouse? And when is it appropriate to use one over the other?

While data lakes and data warehouses are similar in that they both store and process data, each have their own specialties, and therefore their own use cases. That's why it's common for an enterprise-level organization to include a data lake and a data warehouse in their analytics ecosystem. Both repositories work together to form a secure, end-to-end system for storage, processing, and faster time to insight.

A data lake captures both relational and non-relational data from a variety of sources—business applications, mobile apps, IoT devices, social media, or streaming—without having to define the structure or schema of the data until it is read. Schema-on-read ensures that any type of data can be stored in its raw form. As a result, data lakes can hold a wide variety of data types, from structured to semi-structured to unstructured, at any scale. Their flexible and scalable nature make them essential for performing complex forms of data analysis using different types of compute processing tools like Apache Spark or Azure Machine Learning.

By contrast, a data warehouse is relational in nature. The structure or schema is modeled or predefined by business and product requirements that are curated, conformed, and optimized for SQL query operations. While a data lake holds data of all structure types, including raw and unprocessed data, a data warehouse stores data that has been treated and transformed with a specific purpose in mind, which can then be used to source analytic or operational reporting. This makes data warehouses ideal for producing more standardized forms of BI analysis, or for serving a business use case that has already been defined.
