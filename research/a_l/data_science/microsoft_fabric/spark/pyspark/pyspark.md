Discover what Pyspark is and how it can be used while giving examples.

As a data science enthusiast, you are probably familiar with storing files on your local device and processing them using languages like R and Python. However, local workstations have their limitations and cannot handle extremely large datasets.

This is where a distributed processing system like Apache Spark comes in. Distributed processing is a setup in which multiple processors are used to run an application. Instead of trying to process large datasets on a single computer, the task can be divided between multiple devices that communicate with each other.

All this represents an exciting innovation. To follow up on this article, you can practice hands-on exercises with our Introduction to PySpark course, which will open doors for you in the area of parallel computing. The ability to analyze data and train machine learning models on large-scale datasets is a valuable skill to have, and having the expertise to work with big data frameworks like Apache Spark will set you apart from others in the field. If you're new to PySpark and want a detailed learning plan, be sure to check out our guide, How to Learn PySpark From Scratch in 2025.

## What is Apache Spark?

Apache Spark is a distributed processing system used to perform big data and machine learning tasks on large datasets. With Apache Spark, users can run queries and machine learning workflows on petabytes of data, which is impossible to do on your local device.

This framework is even faster than previous data processing engines like Hadoop, and has increased in popularity in the past eight years. Companies like IBM, Amazon, and Yahoo are using Apache Spark as their computational framework.

## What is PySpark?

PySpark is an interface for Apache Spark in Python. With PySpark, you can write Python and SQL-like commands to manipulate and analyze data in a distributed processing environment. Using PySpark, data scientists manipulate data, build machine learning pipelines, and tune models.

Most data scientists and analysts are familiar with Python and use it to implement machine learning workflows. PySpark allows them to work with a familiar language on large-scale distributed datasets. Apache Spark can also be used with other data science programming languages like R. If this is something you are interested in learning, the Introduction to Spark with sparklyr in R course is a great place to start.

## Why Use PySpark?

The reason companies choose to use a framework like PySpark is because of how quickly it can process big data. It is faster than libraries like Pandas and Dask, and can handle larger amounts of data than these frameworks. If you had over petabytes of data to process, for instance, Pandas and Dask would fail but PySpark would be able to handle it easily.

While it is also possible to write Python code on top of a distributed system like Hadoop, many organizations choose to use Spark instead and use the PySpark API since it is faster and can handle real-time data. With PySpark, you can write code to collect data from a source that is continuously updated, while data can only be processed in batch mode with Hadoop.

Apache Flink is a distributed processing system that has a Python API called PyFlink, and is actually faster than Spark in terms of performance. However, Apache Spark has been around for a longer period of time and has better community support, which means that it is more reliable.

Furthermore, PySpark provides fault tolerance, which means that it has the capability to recover loss after a failure occurs. The framework also has in-memory computation and is stored in random access memory (RAM). It can run on a machine that does not have a hard-drive or SSD installed.
