# **[What is Microsoft Fabric?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/fundamentals/microsoft-fabric-overview)**

Microsoft Fabric is an enterprise-ready, end-to-end analytics platform. It unifies data movement, data processing, ingestion, transformation, real-time event routing, and report building. It supports these capabilities with integrated services like Data Engineering, Data Factory, Data Science, Real-Time Intelligence, Data Warehouse, and Databases.

Fabric provides a seamless, user-friendly SaaS experience. It integrates separate components into a cohesive stack. It centralizes data storage with OneLake and embeds AI capabilities, eliminating the need for manual integration. With Fabric, you can efficiently transform raw data into actionable insights.

The Fabric Analyst in a Day (FAIAD) workshop is a free, hands-on training designed for analysts working with Power BI and Microsoft Fabric. You can get hands-on experience on how to analyze data, build reports, using Fabric. It covers key concepts like working with lakehouses, creating reports, and analyzing data in the Fabric environment.

Fabric integrates workloads like Data Engineering, Data Factory, Data Science, Data Warehouse, Real-Time Intelligence, Industry solutions, Databases, and Power BI into a SaaS platform. Each of these workloads is tailored for distinct user roles like data engineers, scientists, or warehousing professionals, and they serve a specific task. Advantages of Fabric include:

- End to end integrated analytics
- Consistent, user-friendly experiences
- Easy access and reuse of all assets
- Unified data lake storage preserving data in its original location
- AI-enhanced stack to accelerate the data journey
- Centralized administration and governance
- Fabric centralizes data discovery, administration, and governance by automatically applying permissions and inheriting data sensitivity labels across all the items in the suite. Governance is powered by Purview, which is built into Fabric. This seamless integration lets creators focus on producing their best work without managing the underlying infrastructure.

## Components of Microsoft Fabric

Fabric offers the following workloads, each customized for a specific role and task:

Power BI - Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources, visualize, and discover what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want. This integrated experience allows business owners to access all data in Fabric quickly and intuitively and to make better decisions with data. For more information, see What is Power BI?

Databases - Databases in Microsoft Fabric are a developer-friendly transactional database such as Azure SQL Database, which allows you to easily create your operational database in Fabric. Using the mirroring capability, you can bring data from various systems together into OneLake. You can continuously replicate your existing data estate directly into Fabric's OneLake, including data from Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Databricks, Snowflake, and Fabric SQL database.
