# **[Fact tables](https://www.kimballgroup.com/2008/11/fact-tables/)**

Fact tables are the foundation of the data warehouse. They contain the fundamental measurements of the enterprise, and they are the ultimate target of most data warehouse queries. There is no point in hoisting fact tables up the flagpole unless they have been chosen to reflect urgent business priorities, have been carefully quality assured and are surrounded by dimensions that provide a wealth of entry points for constraining and grouping. Now that we have paved the way for fact tables, letâ€™s see how to build them and use them.

## Stay True to the Grain

The first and most important design step is declaring the fact table grain. The grain is the business definition of what a single fact table record represents. The grain declaration is not a list of dimensional foreign keys that implement a primary key for the fact table. Rather, the grain is the description of the measurement event in the physical world that gives rise to a measurement. When the grocery store scanner measures the quantity and the charged price of a product being purchased, the grain is literally the beep of the scanner. That is a great grain definition!
