A data mart is a focused subset of a data warehouse designed to serve a specific business unit or department, like sales or marketing. They are more efficient than a full data warehouse for targeted analysis and reporting because they contain pre-processed data from a particular subject area. Data marts improve team efficiency, reduce costs, and facilitate quicker decision-making by providing simpler data access for specific needs.  

## Key characteristics

- Subject-oriented: Data marts are tailored to a single subject, such as finance, sales, or marketing, making them highly specific.
Subset of a data warehouse: They draw data from a central data warehouse or other operational sources, but only a portion relevant to a specific group.
- Faster and cheaper: Compared to a full data warehouse, they are quicker and cheaper to set up and maintain because they handle a smaller, more focused dataset.
- Simplified data access: The structure is optimized for easy retrieval and analysis by a specific user group.

## Types of data marts

- Dependent: Data is sourced directly from a central data warehouse, ensuring consistency across departments.

- Independent: Data is pulled directly from operational systems, creating a mini-data mart for specific, tactical needs.

- Hybrid: Combines aspects of both, starting independently but with the potential to be integrated into a central data warehouse later.

## Common structure

- Data marts commonly use a dimensional model with a central fact table and surrounding dimension tables, often referred to as a star schema.
- The fact table contains quantifiable data (metrics), while dimension tables provide descriptive context (like time, location, or product).

## Use and limitations

- Use cases: Ideal for business intelligence, generating dashboards, and creating reports for a specific team.
- Limitations: Data silos can form, and they are not suitable for the complex, broad queries that a full data warehouse can handle. Overuse can also lead to data redundancy and quality issues.
