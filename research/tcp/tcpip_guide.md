Named for two key protocols of the many that comprise it, TCP/IP has been in continual development and use for about three decades. In that time, it has evolved from an experimental technology used to hook together a handful of research computers, to the powerhouse of the largest and most complex computer network in history: the global Internet, connecting together millions of networks and end devices.
