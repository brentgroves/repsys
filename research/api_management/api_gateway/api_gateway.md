## Kong Gateway (Open Source)

Kong Gateway (OSS) is a popular open-source API gateway due to its slick interface, vibrant community, cloud-native architecture, and extensive features. It’s also extremely fast and lightweight. Kong also has ready-made deployments for many popular container and cloud-based environments, from Docker to Kubernetes to AWS. This allows you to easily integrate Kong into your existing workflow, making the learning curve much less steep.

Kong supports logging, authentication, rate limiting, failure detection, and much more. Even better, it has its own CLI, so you can manage and interact with Kong directly from the command line. You can install the open-source community Kong Gateway on various distributions. Basically, Kong has everything you could want from an API gateway.

## Tyk Open-Source API Gateway

Tyk has been called the “industry-best API gateway.” Unlike other API gateways on our list, Tyk is indeed open-source — not just open-core or freemium. It offers an impressive array of features and functions for an open-source solution. Like Kong, Tyk is also cloud-native and has many plugins available. Tyk can even be used to publish your own APIs in both REST and GraphQL formats.

Tyk has native support for many features, including various forms of authentication, quotas, rate limiting, and versioning. It can even generate API documentation. Most impressively of all, Tyk features an API developer portal that lets you publish managed APIs, so third parties can sign up for your APIs and even manage their API keys. It’s rather incredible how much Tyk offers with its open-source API gateway.

Tyk Gateway is the cloud-native, open source, API Gateway.
We support REST, GraphQL, TCP and gRPC protocols.

Built from the ground up, as the fastest API Gateway on the planet since 2014.

Tyk Gateway is provided ‘Batteries-included’, with no feature lockout. Enabling your organization to rate limit, auth, gather analytics, apply microservice patterns and more with ease.

Tyk runs natively on Kubernetes, if you prefer, thanks to the Tyk Kubernetes Operator
