## History

The initial release, CentOS Stream 8, was released on 24 September 2019, at the same time as CentOS 8.[3] As CentOS 8 became unsupported, the CentOS Project provided a simple means of converting from CentOS Linux 8 to CentOS Stream 8.[7] On 13 January 2021, CentOS board approved the creation of Hyperscale SIG proposed by Meta Platforms, Twitter, and Verizon engineers,[6][8] which focus on enabling CentOS Stream deployment on large-scale infrastructures and facilitating collaboration on packages and tooling.

CentOS Stream 9 was released on 3 December 2021,[9] with support of IBM Z architecture.

In 2023, Red Hat announced that CentOS 7 and CentOS Stream 8 will be discontinued in 2024 in order to focus on Red Hat Enterprise Linux development. CentOS Stream 9 was given as one possible migration path.[10]
