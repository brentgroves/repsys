## AI Overview

Rocky Linux is a community-driven Linux distribution designed as a direct replacement for the discontinued CentOS Linux, offering the same stability and binary compatibility with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

## Rocky Linux

Rocky Linux is a binary-compatible operating system based on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) source code. It is regarded as the unofficial successor to the discontinued CentOS.

## What Is Rocky Linux?

Like CentOS, Rocky Linux downstream distribution is a popular option for workstations and virtual private servers (VPS). It is a popular alternative to another RHEL clone, CentOS.

Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation (RESF) develops the operating system and offers ten-year support with regular updates. This enterprise-ready Linux distribution is commonly used for business servers or workstations.

Licensing
Rocky Linux is a free version of RHEL, as the latter costs $349/year. Since it acts like an unlicensed RHEL, some of Red Hat’s features are unavailable.

For instance, RHEL 8.1 comes with the kpatch live kernel patching feature. Rocky Linux doesn’t support it and requires a third-party paid service for the task.

All elements in the Rocky Linux project are licensed under the 3-Clause Berkley Software Distribution (BSD). This applies to the operating system’s reuse, redistribution, and modification.

As a distribution, Rocky Linux includes several packages or software with different licenses. When using the operating system, you must also comply with the regulations of each one.

To see the installed components’ licenses, use the following command in the Terminal:

```bash
sudo yum info package-name
```
