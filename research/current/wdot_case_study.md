Wyoming Department of Transportation keeps drivers safe and informed by pivoting from hypervisors to LXD

## Highlights

• To optimise database cost and performance,
WYDOT migrated from VMs on Hyper-V to LXD
system containers
• LXD has doubled performance with half the
resources compared to traditional hypervisors
• WYDOT can configure up to 8 new containers in
under an hour for unprecedented scalability

## Quotes

“With LXD there’s no loss
of function like you get
with a hypervisor. We
benchmarked it against
our existing environment
and it delivered twice the
performance on our database
with half the resources.”
— Suzie Roseberry,
Intelligent Transportation Systems
Developer and Database Administrator
at WYDOT

“Moving from hypervisors to
the container technology that
LXD offers on Ubuntu was like
a quantum leap for us in terms
of concept and performance.”
— Marcel Redöhl,
Geographic Information Systems and
Intelligent Transportation System

## Solution

WYDOT began looking for an operating system that would be
as performant and cost-effective as possible. What’s more, after
CentOS was unexpectedly discontinued, the agency wanted a
well-established, industry-leading platform that it would be able
to rely on long-term. Ubuntu was the ideal fit for these criteria,
and the organisation reached out to Canonical to support the
implementation. It was at this point that WYDOT learned
about LXD.
“In our first meeting with Canonical we ended up completely
pivoting our plan,” says Vince Garcia. “They told us about LXD,
and it was the perfect solution. We’d intended to build a full KVM
environment on Ubuntu, but LXD was an even better option.”
LXD is an image-based system container and virtual machine
manager from Canonical that enables users to run a full Linux OS
inside a container. Eliminating the need for a traditional hypervisor,
LXD delivers the same performance as bare metal, and new
containers can be spun up in a matter of seconds for
seamless scalability.
“With LXD there’s no loss of function like you get with a
hypervisor,” confirms Suzie Roseberry, ITS Developer and Database
Administrator at WYDOT. “We benchmarked it against our existing
environment and it delivered twice the performance on our
database with half the resources.”
WYDOT quickly got to work implementing LXD and migrating
as many workloads as possible to Ubuntu. Canonical helped the
agency define its new strategy through a series of predesign
meetings, then provided hands-on support setting up the LXD
environment across two datacentres. Throughout the process,
Canonical delivered training and knowledge transfer so that
WYDOT’s internal team would be able to manage, maintain, and
scale the system on their own moving forwards.
“Canonical’s process is very well structured and fine-tuned,” adds
Vince Garcia. “They got us up and running in just a few days, and
gave us the skillset and understanding to expand the environment
on our own.”

Results
With LXD and Ubuntu in place, WYDOT’s Travel Information Service
is performing better than ever while operating at a fraction of the
cost of the old system.
Vince Garcia comments: “Moving from hypervisors to the container
technology that LXD offers on Ubuntu was like a quantum leap for
us in terms of concept and performance. Even our experienced
Linux engineers were surprised and impressed by LXD’s
capabilities.”
Now, the agency can not only meet existing demand, it also has
the space and resources to effortlessly scale up as website traffic
continues to grow.
“Setting up LXD containers is amazingly fast,” says Suzie Roseberry.
“We’ve been able to configure eight containers in under an hour.
And with Canonical’s help, we’ve ensured that the process is highly
repeatable.”
To maximise security and uptime for the new environment,
WYDOT opted for 24/7 support from Canonical through the
Ubuntu Advantage for Infrastructure package. Looking ahead, the
organisation has plans to expand its use of Canonical tooling even
further, starting with Landscape for streamlined management of
Ubuntu machines.
“Seeing the performance of our database with LXD, we’re smiling
from ear to ear,” concludes Vince Garcia. “It might be the best
money we’ve spent in the last five years.”
