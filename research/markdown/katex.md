Simple API, no dependencies – yet super fast on all major browsers.

- Fast: KaTeX renders its math synchronously and doesn’t need to reflow the page.
- Print quality: KaTeX’s layout is based on Donald Knuth’s TeX, the gold standard for math typesetting.
- Self contained: KaTeX has no dependencies and can easily be bundled with your website resources.
- Server side rendering: KaTeX produces the same output regardless of browser or environment, so you can pre-render expressions using Node.js and send them as plain HTML.

$\displaystyle \frac{1}{\Bigl(\sqrt{\phi \sqrt{5}}-\phi\Bigr) e^{\frac25 \pi}} = 1+\frac{e^{-2\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-4\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-6\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-8\pi}} {1+\cdots} } } }$
