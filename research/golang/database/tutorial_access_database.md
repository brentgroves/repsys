## Tutorial: Accessing a relational database

This tutorial introduces the basics of accessing a relational database with Go and the database/sql package in its standard library.

You’ll get the most out of this tutorial if you have a basic familiarity with Go and its tooling. If this is your first exposure to Go, please see Tutorial: Get started with Go for a quick introduction.

The database/sql package you’ll be using includes types and functions for connecting to databases, executing transactions, canceling an operation in progress, and more. For more details on using the package, see Accessing databases.

In this tutorial, you’ll create a database, then write code to access the database. Your example project will be a repository of data about vintage jazz records.
