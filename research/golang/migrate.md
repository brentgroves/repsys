## Go migrate

Database migrations written in Go. Use as CLI or import as library.

Migrate reads migrations from sources and applies them in correct order to a database.
Drivers are "dumb", migrate glues everything together and makes sure the logic is bulletproof. (Keeps the drivers lightweight, too.)
Database drivers don't assume things or try to correct user input. When in doubt, fail.
