| **[Can we use Ansible to automate reoccuring tasks associated with managing our report system?](ansible.md#can-we-use-ansible-to-automate-reoccuring-tasks-associated-with-managing-our-report-system)** | Yes. Ansible is an open-source automation tool that helps automate various IT tasks such as configuration management application deployment and task automation. It uses an agentless architecture meaning it does not require any software to be installed on the target systems. Instead, it uses SSH for communication and Python for scripting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

The deciding factor for me was that gRPC gives you HTTP 2 feature support such as streaming and an IDL language enabling you to generate client code in any language using the protoc compiler so will try out gRPC micro services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Unfortunately, the message broker approach to request services is difficult to secure in a standard and uncomplicated way. Fortunately, we can use the Envoy proxy features of our Istio gateway to secure our micro services by enabling the automatic sidecar creation feature of Istio.  By doing this we will have a TLS secured request channel between our micro services without having to write any additional code using a well accepted design pattern.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
