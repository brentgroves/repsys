Through the SaaS or "Software as a Service" model, technology service providers make software applications installed in remote data centers available to users.

This model involves users accessing their management applications via the Internet, usually with a simple web browser. From there, they can fully administer and manage all the applications available from the service provider's data center.

This is already a prevailing reality in many areas. Electronic Data Interchange â€“ EDI is probably one of the environments with the highest level of development in SaaS mode.

Cloud-based EDI applications are designed to be integrated with the management system or ERP of the client company. This implies establishing communication systems that allow data transfer between the management system and the SaaS EDI solution. This enables a constant and automatic exchange of sent and received documents.
