Research,Summary
**[How should we notify a customer there report is finished?](./research_summary.md)**,"Use HTTP2 push notifications because there is a industry standard way of knowing who you are sending messages to."
**[Which K8s Gateway should we use?](k8s_gateway.md)**,"Use **Istio** which leverages **[Envoy](https://tetrate.io/what-is-envoy-proxy/)** proxy server technology to support about every possible Application Delivery Controller, **[ADC](https://kemptechnologies.com/blog/what-is-an-application-delivery-controller-(adc)-and-why-should-you-use-one)**, feature such as retries, circuit breakers, rate limiting, tls termination, and metrics."
**[Should the report system use REST or gRPC based micro services?](rest_vs_grpc.md#summary)**,"Either REST or gRPC would be a perfectly acceptable way of implementing our micro services. The deciding factor for me was that gRPC gives you HTTP 2 feature support such as streaming and an IDL language enabling you to generate client code in any language using the protoc compiler so will try out gRPC micro services."
**[How should our Micro Services communicate with each other?](./microservice_communication.md)**,"In the Tool Tracker we used a message broker to make east-west requests of our micro services. Unfortunately, the message broker approach to request services is difficult to secure in a standard and uncomplicated way. Fortunately, we can use the Envoy proxy features of our Istio gateway to secure our micro services by enabling the automatic sidecar creation feature of Istio.  By doing this we will have a TLS secured request channel between our micro services without having to write any additional code using a well accepted design pattern."
