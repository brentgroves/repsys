# **[Head method](https://http.dev/head#:~:text=The%20HTTP%20HEAD%20method%20is,following%20the%20HTTP%20header%20section.)**

The HTTP HEAD method is a type of HTTP request that is identical to HTTP GET, except that the server will not return a message-body as part of the HTTP response. Rather, it will only send the HTTP headers and will end immediately following the HTTP header section.
