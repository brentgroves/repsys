## **[Site-to-Site VPN](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-a-site-to-site-vpn)**

A site-to-site virtual private network (VPN) is a connection between two or more networks, such as a corporate network and a branch office network. Many organizations use site-to-site VPNs to leverage an internet connection for private traffic as an alternative to using private MPLS circuits.

Site-to-site VPNs are frequently used by companies with multiple offices in different geographic locations that need to access and use the corporate network on an ongoing basis. With a site-to-site VPN, a company can securely connect its corporate network with its remote offices to communicate and share resources with them as a single network.

Site-to-site VPNs and remote access VPNs may sound similar, but they serve entirely different purposes.

- A site-to-site VPN is a permanent connection designed to function as an encrypted link between offices (i.e., “sites”). This is typically set up as an IPsec network connection between networking equipment.

Unlike a remote access VPN, which connects individual devices or users to an organization’s corporate network, a site-to-site VPN is a connection between two or more networks, such as a corporate network and a branch office network. Many organizations choose site-to-site VPNs so they can use an internet connection for private traffic rather than private multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) circuits.
