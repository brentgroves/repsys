Family Specific Terms) or section 4 (Product Specific Terms), as applicable, 
and you must distribute or offer access to the Redistributables subject to a

customer from any further distribution of the Redistributables (unless 
expressly permitted pursuant to section 3 (Product Family Specific Terms) or

Perpetual and Term License Types, unless otherwise expressly stated by us in 
the Order, first year annual maintenance and support (if offered by us) is 
required for the Product and starts on the date the Product is delivered. 
Thereafter, you may choose to purchase annual maintenance and support (if 
offered by us). If you do not purchase renewal maintenance and support services 
for a Product, then you will not receive any maintenance and support services 
for that Product and will have no entitlement to any benefits of maintenance 
and support services including, bug fixes, patches, upgrades, enhancements, new 
releases or technical support. If you want to reinstate lapsed maintenance and 
support services on a Product, and we offer reinstatement to our customers, 
then you may re-instate maintenance and support services by paying the 
then-current fee, plus a reinstatement fee for the lapsed maintenance and 
support period in accordance with our maintenance and support reinstatement 
policies then in effect.
1.7.3. Maintenance and Support for Subscription License Type.  If the license

We may charge you interest at a rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate 
permitted by law, if less) on all overdue payments. You agree to pay any sales, 
value-added or other similar taxes imposed by applicable law that we must pay 
on such fees, except those based on our income. Invoices may be issued by our 
Affiliate. If you and we agree that you will pay by credit card, you will 
provide us with valid and updated credit card information and you authorize us

subscription will be calculated at the then-current price offered for the 
Product at the time of renewal.

specified in the Order or in section 3 (Product Family Specific Terms) or 
section 4 (Product-Specific Terms), the fee for an optional annual renewal 
maintenance and support term for the Product will be calculated based on the 
annual rate applicable for the initial maintenance and support term or 
immediately preceding renewal maintenance and support term, whichever is 
applicable, plus a rate increase, if applicable, calculated at the lesser of 
any standard price increase or CPI (or equivalent index) after applying any 
increases as a consequence of our Lifetime Support policy, if applicable.

above terms of this section 1.8 (Fees and Taxes), if you purchased your license

you and the Authorized Reseller may differ from the terms set out in this 
section 1.8 (Fees and Taxes).

power and authority to enter into this EULA.
1.9.2. Product Compliance with Documentation.  We warrant to you that, for six

duration of the license (in the case of a Hosted Service), the Product will 
comply with the applicable Documentation in all material respects. Your 
exclusive remedy, and our sole liability, with respect to any breach of this 
warranty will be for us to use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly 
correct the non-compliance (provided that you notify us in writing within the 
warranty period and allow us a reasonable cure period).  If we, at our 
discretion, reasonably determine that correction is not economically or 
technically feasible, we may terminate your license to the Product and provide 
you a full refund of the fees paid to us with respect to the Product (in the 
case of an On-Premise Product) or a refund of the prepaid fees for the unused 
portion of the license period (in the case of a Hosted Service). Delivery of 
additional copies of, or Updates to, the Product will not restart or otherwise 
affect the warranty period.
1.9.3. Warranty Exclusions.  The warranty specified in section 1.9.2 (Product 
Compliance with Documentation) does not cover any Product provided on an unpaid 
evaluation or trial basis, or defects to the Product due to accident, abuse, 
service, alteration, modification or improper installation or configuration by 
you, your Affiliates, your or their personnel or any third party not engaged by 
us. 
1.9.4. Warranty Disclaimers.  EXCEPT FOR THE WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY STATED IN 
THIS SECTION 1.9 OR THE ADDITIONAL WARRANTIES (IF ANY) EXPRESSLY STATED IN 
SECTION 3 (PRODUCT FAMILY SPECIFIC TERMS) OR SECTION 4 (PRODUCT SPECIFIC 
TERMS), THE PRODUCT, DOCUMENTATION AND OUR TECHNOLOGY  ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", 
WITH ALL FAULTS, AND WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,

PURPOSE, TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT, AVAILABILITY, ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED 
OPERATION, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF 
PERFORMANCE, OR USAGE OF TRADE. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE MAY NOT AS A MATTER OF 
APPLICABLE LAW DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY, THE SCOPE AND DURATION OF SUCH 
WARRANTY WILL BE THE MINIMUM PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.
1.10. Indemnification.
1.10.1. Our Indemnification Obligation.
       1.10.1.1. Intellectual Property Infringement.  We will defend you, and 
your officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all 
third party claims, lawsuits, and proceedings alleging that your use of the 
Product, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this EULA, constitutes 
a direct infringement or misappropriation of such third party's patent, 
copyright or trade secret rights (the "IP Claim"), and we will indemnify you 
for damages finally awarded against you by a court of competent jurisdiction 
with respect to the IP Claim. 
       1.10.1.2. Exceptions.  We will not indemnify you to the extent that the 
alleged infringement or misappropriation results from (a) use of the Product in 
combination with any other software or item not supplied by us; (b) failure to 
promptly implement an Update provided by us pursuant to 1.10.1.3 (Our Options); 
(c) modification of the Product not made or provided by us; or (d) use of the 
Product in a manner not permitted by this EULA. We also will not indemnify you 
if we notify you of our decision to terminate this EULA, and the license to the 
Product granted hereunder, in accordance with section 1.10.1.3 (Our Options) 
and you have not ceased all use of the Product within thirty (30) days of such 
notification. 
       1.10.1.3. Our Options.  If a final injunction is, or we reasonably 
believe that it could be, obtained against your use of the Product, or if in 
our opinion the Product is likely to become the subject of a successful claim 
of infringement, we may, at our option and expense, (a) replace or modify the 
Product so that it becomes non-infringing (provided that the functionality is 
substantially equivalent), (b) obtain for you a license to continue to use the 
Product, or (c) if neither (a) nor (b) are reasonably practicable, terminate 
this EULA on thirty (30) days' notice and, if the Product was licensed to you 
on a Perpetual License or Term License basis, refund to you the license fee 
paid to us for the Product less an amount for depreciation determined on a 
straight-line five year (or actual term if shorter) depreciation basis with a 
commencement date as of the date of delivery of the Product, or if the Product 
was licensed to you on a Subscription License basis, refund to you the unused 
portion of the fees paid in advance to us for the then-current subscription 
period for the Product. THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS SET OUT IN THIS SECTION 
1.10.1 STATE OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY AND YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH 
RESPECT TO ANY INFRINGEMENT OR ALLEGED INFRINGEMENT BY US OF ANY INTELLECTUAL 
PROPERTY RIGHTS OR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN RESPECT OF THE PRODUCT OR ITS USE.
1.10.2. Your Indemnification Obligation.
       1.10.2.1. Indemnification for Third Party-Claims.  To the extent 
permitted by applicable law, you will defend us and our Affiliates, and our and 
their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against 
any and all third party claims, lawsuits, and proceedings that arise or result 
from (a) your breach of this EULA, (b) your use, distribution and/or licensing 
of the Redistributables, if applicable, except to the extent it arises from an 
IP Claim covered under section 1.10.1 above, or (c) your failure or alleged 
failure to comply with Applicable Laws or any violation of a third party's 
rights in connection with your use of the Product (each a "Third-Party Claim" 
and collectively "Third-Party Claims") and you will indemnify for damages 
finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction with respect to any 
Third-Party Claim. 
1.10.3. Control of the Defense or Settlement. For any indemnification 
obligation covered in section 1.10.1,"Indemnifying Party" means us, 
"Indemnified Party" means you, and "Claim" means an IP Claim. For any 
indemnification obligation covered in section 1.10.2, "Indemnifying Party" 
means you, "Indemnified Party" means us, and "Claim" means a Third-Party Claim. 
The Indemnified Party must provide the Indemnifying Party with prompt written 
notice of a Claim; however, the Indemnified Party's failure to provide or delay 
in providing such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its 
obligations under this section except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is 
prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's failure or delay. The Indemnified Party 
will give the Indemnifying Party full control of the defense and settlement of 
the Claim as long as such settlement does not include a financial obligation on 
or admission of liability by the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party 
does not do so, then the Indemnified Party waives the Indemnifying Party's 
indemnification obligations under section 1.10.1 or 1.10.2, as applicable. The 
Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate in the defense of the Claim and may 
appear, at its own expense, through counsel reasonably acceptable to the 
Indemnifying Party.
1.11. Confidentiality.  
1.11.1. Confidentiality Obligations.  Except as otherwise provided herein, each 
party agrees to retain in confidence all information and know-how transmitted 
or disclosed to the other that the disclosing party has identified as being 
proprietary and/or confidential or should reasonably  be  understood  to  be  
confidential  given  the  nature  of  the  information  and  the  circumstances 
surrounding its disclosure, and agrees to make no use of such information and 
know-how except under the terms of this EULA. However, neither party will have 
an obligation to maintain the confidentiality of information that (a) it 
received rightfully from a third party without an obligation to maintain such 
information in confidence; (b) was known to the receiving party prior to its 
disclosure by the disclosing party; (c) is or becomes a matter of public 
knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; or (d) is independently 
developed by the receiving party without use of the confidential information of 
the disclosing party. Further, either party may disclose confidential 
information of the other party as required by governmental or judicial order, 
provided such party gives the other party prompt written notice prior to such 
disclosure (unless such prior notice is not permitted by applicable law) and 
complies with any protective order (or equivalent) imposed on such disclosure. 
You will treat any source code for the Product as our confidential information 
and will not disclose, disseminate or distribute such materials to any third 
party without our prior written permission. Each party's obligations under this 
section 1.11 will apply during the term of this EULA and for five (5) years 
following termination of this EULA, provided, however, that (i) obligations 
with respect to source code will survive forever and (ii) trade secrets will be 
maintained as such until they fall into the public domain.
1.11.2. Product Benchmark Results.  You acknowledge that any benchmark results 
pertaining to the Product are our confidential information and may not be 
disclosed or published without our prior written consent. This provision 
applies regardless of whether the benchmark tests are conducted by you or us.
1.11.3. Remedies for Breach of Confidentiality Obligations.  Each party 
acknowledges that in the event of a breach or threat of breach of this section 
1.11, money damages will not be adequate. Therefore, in addition to any other 
legal or equitable remedies, the non-breaching party will be entitled to seek 
injunctive or similar equitable relief against such breach or threat of breach 
without proof of actual injury and without posting of a bond.
1.12. Data Collection and Personal Data.

section 1.14 (Audit), you may submit a written request at 
privacy@progress.com   for the mutual execution of a Data Processing Addendum 
substantially in the form we make available at

ddendum.pdf and we will enter into such Data Processing Addendum with you. To 
the extent there is any conflict between this EULA and such Data Processing 
Addendum, the Data Processing Addendum will prevail with respect to our 
handling and processing of your Personal Data. 
1.13. Limitation of Liability and Disclaimer of Certain Types of Damages.
1.13.1. Limitation of Liability.  EXCEPT FOR A PARTY'S INDEMNIFICATION 
OBLIGATIONS SET OUT IN THIS EULA OR A PARTY'S BREACH OF ITS CONFIDENTIALITY

SET OUT IN THIS EULA, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT 
WILL EITHER PARTY'S LIABILITY FOR ALL COSTS, DAMAGES, AND EXPENSES ARISING OUT 
OF OR RELATED TO THIS EULA WHETHER BASED UPON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT 
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE AT LAW EXCEED, IN THE 
AGGREGATE, THE FEES PAID TO US FOR THE PRODUCT AND/OR SERVICE THAT IS THE 
SUBJECT OF THE CLAIM, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT IF THE FEES PAID FOR SUCH PRODUCT 
AND/OR SERVICE ARE PAID ON A RECURRING BASIS, THEN THE NOT TO EXCEED LIMIT WILL

MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE THE CLAIM AROSE. OUR AFFILIATES AND

EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER 
PERSON OR ENTITY FOR DAMAGES, DIRECT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF THIS EULA, 
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH THE PERFORMANCE OR 
OPERATION OF OUR PRODUCTS OR OUR PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES. 
1.13.2	Disclaimer of Certain Types of Damages.  EXCEPT FOR A PARTY'S

LOSS OF OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF PROFITS, OR LOSS OF 
BUSINESS, EVEN IF THE PARTY, ITS AFFILIATES, ITS LICENSORS, OR ANY OF THEIR 
RESPECTIVE SUPPLIERS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THOSE DAMAGES.
1.14. Audit.  We may install and use automated license tracking, management 
and/or enforcement solutions with the Product, which you may not disrupt or 
alter. You will maintain records in connection with this EULA and the use of 
the Product and any Updates and/or services provided hereunder. Such records 
will include at a minimum the number of licenses purchased and being used by 
you. At our expense and with reasonable written notice to you, we or a third 
party appointed by us may audit the records, and if necessary and as 
applicable, the systems on which the Product or any Update is installed for the 
sole purpose of ensuring compliance with the terms of this EULA. We will have 
the right to conduct audits as necessary. These audits may be conducted on 
site at a location where you have installed the Product, remotely from our 
offices, or a combination of both, if applicable to the Product. On-site audits 
will be conducted during regular business hours, and neither on-site nor remote 
audits will interfere unreasonably with your business operations. You agree to 
share with us copies of all records referenced herein, as well as Product log 
files and other information reasonably requested by us promptly following such 
request, but in no event more than five (5) business days following receipt of 
our written request (or such longer period, if applicable, that we specify in 
the written request). We will treat all such information obtained or accessed 
by us during the audit as confidential information pursuant to section 1.11 
(Confidentiality) for use by us only as necessary to ensure compliance with and 
enforcement of the terms of this EULA. If any audit reveals that you have 
underpaid license, maintenance and support or subscription fees, you will be 
invoiced for all such underpaid fees based on our list price in effect at the 
time the audit is completed. If the underpaid fees exceed five percent (5%) of 
the fees previously paid by you, then you will also pay our reasonable costs of 
conducting the audit and enforcement of this EULA.
1.15. Termination. 
1.15.1. Termination for Breach.  We may terminate this EULA by written notice 
at any time if you do not comply with any of your obligations under this EULA

other remedies which we may have under this EULA or otherwise. 
1.15.2. Effect of Termination.  Upon expiration of your license term to the 
Product (if applicable) or earlier termination of this EULA, your license to

Permitted Third Parties to do the same). Any licenses you have granted to the 
Redistributables in accordance with the terms and conditions of this EULA will, 
unless otherwise specified in section 3 (Product Family Specific Terms) or 
section 4 (Product Specific Terms), survive termination of this EULA.
1.15.3. Survival.  Any provisions of this EULA containing licensing 
restrictions, warranties and warranty disclaimers, confidentiality obligations, 
limitations of liability and/or indemnity terms, audits rights, and any term of 
this EULA which, by its nature, is intended to survive termination or 
expiration, will remain in effect following any termination or expiration if 
this EULA, as will your obligation to pay any fees accrued and owing to us as 
of termination or expiration.

novate this EULA, any of your rights or obligations under this EULA, or the 
Products or any of our Confidential Information, in whole or in part, by 
operation of law, sale of assets, merger or otherwise, to any other party,

parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agree to submit to the exclusive 
jurisdiction and venue of such court. The Uniform Computer Information 
Transactions Act and the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of 
Goods will not apply to this EULA.

remainder of this EULA will remain in full force and effect. 
1.19.4. Waiver.  Failure or delay in exercising any right, power, privilege or

3.4. Product Family License Models. This section specifies license models that 
may be applicable to one or more Products. Note that not all license models are 
available for all Products. 
3.4.1. CPU License. A CPU License grants you the right to run the Product, or 
an application which can access the Product, on a single CPU, on a single 
Server and on a single Platform, where such CPU contains only one Core. If the 
CPU contains more than one Core, then you must either purchase a Core License 
for the Product or, if no Core License model is available for the Product, then 
each Core in the CPU will count as one (1) CPU. Additional CPU License(s) are 
required for each CPU on a Server that runs the Product, including, without 
limitation, Servers configured for disaster recovery, load balancing, 
clustering, development, testing and reporting. A CPU License may not be 
transferred from one Server or Platform to another.
3.4.2. Named User/Seat License.  A Named User or Seat License grants you the 
right to designate a Named User to access and use the Product or access and use 
an application which can access the Product. You must be able to identify and 
count each Named User. A Named User License is a multi-server license in that 
it is not limited by Core, CPU or Server count, but the Product must be used on 
a single Platform. A Named User may not be designated concurrently on different 
computers or devices or shared by multiple users. A Named User does not have to 
be logged on to the Product to be counted as a Named User. A Named User License 
designation may be transferred from one Named User to another provided that the 
original Named User no longer requires and is no longer permitted access to the 
Product. The foregoing transfer right will not affect the assignment 
prohibition set forth in section 1.16 (No Assignment). All Named Users must be 
bound to the terms and conditions of this EULA.
3.4.3. Server/Machine License.  A Server or Machine License grants you the 
right to install and use the Product, or an application which can access the 
Product, on a single Server and on a single Platform. Additional Server or 
Machine License(s) are required for each Server that runs the Product 
including, without limitation, Servers configured for disaster recovery, load 
balancing, clustering, development, testing and reporting. A Server or Machine 
License may not be transferred from one Server or Platform to another.
3.4.4. Site License.  A Site License grants you the right to install and use 
the Product, or an application which can access the Product, in any Server at a 
single Site and on any device (wherein the device can be a Client Device, a 
Non-Human Operated Device or a Process) operated by users who share the same 
principal place of business as the Site location, regardless of whether the 
Product, or an application which can access the Product is used in a 
virtualized and/or non-virtualized environment.
3.4.5. Application Specific License.  If the Order lists a specific application 
authorized for use with the Product, or if you obtained the Product in 
conjunction with a software application provided by a third party, the Product 
is licensed for use only with that application. Use with any other 
application/product is strictly prohibited. You will also be subject to the 
license terms of the appropriate license model for the Product (e.g., CPU 
License, Core License, Named User/Seat License, etc.) designated in the Order. 
In no event do we make any representations or warranties, express, implied or 
arising by custom or trade usage, regarding a third party's application and 
assume no liability or responsibility for such application.
3.4.6. Developer License.  A Developer License limits your access to and use of 
the Product to internal application development and support purposes only. If 
the license is for components of the Product only, then this right is limited 
to those components. You will also be subject to the license terms of the 
appropriate license model for the Product (e.g., CPU License, Core License, 
Server/Machine License, etc.) designated in the Order. A Developer License may 
not be transferred. 
3.4.7. Disaster Recovery License.  A Disaster Recovery License will only be 
used by you for the sole purpose of application recovery in the event a system 
fails or crashes or the Product or database files become corrupt. In that case, 
a Disaster Recovery License grants you the right to use the Product for a 
period not to exceed ninety (90) days ("D/R Deployment Period"). You will 
notify us in writing within five (5) business days of the commencement of the 
D/R Deployment Period. You will also be subject to the same quantity limits and
