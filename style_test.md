Investigate!

For the complete graphs $k_n$  we would like to be able to say something about the number of vertices, edges, and (if the graph is planar) faces. Let's first consider $k_3$

1. How many vertices does $k_3$  have? How many edges?
2. If $k_3$ is planar, how many faces should it have?

Repeat parts (1) and (2) for $k_4,\,k_5,and\,k_{23}$.

What about complete bipartite graphs? How many vertices, edges, and faces (if it were planar) does
 have? For which values of
 and
 are
 and
 planar?
