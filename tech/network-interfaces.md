# Network Interfaces

You can create as many network interfaces on a host as you desire.  Each interface can be assigned a unique IP addess.  If you ping the IP address associated with the main network interface and you are on another computer in the same subdomain it only takes one hop. Pinging the IP address associated with a secondary network interface takes two hops.
