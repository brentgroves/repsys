## Get started with Juju

Juju is a tool for provisioning cloud infrastructure and deploying and operating applications on that infrastructure using charms. Charms are software packages that contain code for how to operate an application. Juju and charms work together to provide a cloud- and application-agnostic operations solution for any major operation (provision, install, configure, integrate, scale, upgrade, …) on any type of cloud (Kubernetes or machines).
