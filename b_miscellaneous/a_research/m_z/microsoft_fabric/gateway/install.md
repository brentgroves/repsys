# **[Install an on-premises data gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-install)**

An on-premises data gateway is software that you install in an on-premises network. The gateway facilitates access to data in that network.

As we explain in the overview, you can install a gateway either in personal mode, which applies to Power BI only, or in standard mode. We recommend standard mode. In that mode, you can install a standalone gateway or add a gateway to a cluster, which we recommend for high availability.

In this article, we show you how to install a standard gateway, how to add another gateway to create a cluster, and how to install a personal mode gateway.
