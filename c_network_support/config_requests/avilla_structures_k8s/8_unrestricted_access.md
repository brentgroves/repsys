Project: Avilla Structures Kubernetes Cluster
Request: Please update the Avilla Structures "Kubernetes" policy to allow unrestricted internet access for one week starting on Mar 13th.
Reason:  We are requesting unrestricted access to determine if an internet access restriction is the issue preventing MicroK8s services from starting.
Details: After installing  Canonical's MicroK8s, none of the services started. We have created a bug report on the Canonical MicroK8s GitHub page to help identify the exact issue.  
Business Justification:  The Avilla Structures Kubernetes Cluster will run Structures Information System software such as the Automated Report System, Tool Management System, and Tool Tracker Focused **[Manufacturing Execution System](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/mes-system)**. These projects are for Linamar Structures but are currently directed toward Southfield, Albion, Avilla, and possibly Mills River.
