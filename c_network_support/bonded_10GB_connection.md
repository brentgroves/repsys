Project: Avilla Structures Kubernetes Cluster

Request: Please update all 3 PowerEdge R620s at our Avilla location with a **[DELL Mt09V Broadcom 57800S Quadport Sfp+ Rack Converged Network Daughter Card](https://www.ebay.com/itm/DELL-Mt09V-Broadcom-57800S-Quadport-Sfp-Rack-Converged-Network-Daughter-Card/303465861553?epid=1622568435&hash=item46a7f991b1:g:wlEAAOSw5eNeMc9-)** to support two 10GB SPF+ modules.  Then connect to the extreme core switches in a bond configuration to the Fortigate Firewall pair.  Then configure the bonded pair in trunk mode on VLANs 50 and 220.

Reason: Our Avilla Structures Kubernetes cluster needs a fast connection to other Structure locations, especially Southfield and possibly Mills River for now, and others in the future, to serve our Structures **[mTLS](https://www.f5.com/labs/learning-center/what-is-mtls#:~:text=Mutual%20Transport%20Layer%20Security%20(mTLS)%20is%20a%20process%20that%20establishes,parties%20from%20imitating%20genuine%20apps.)** based **[Microservices](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-microservices-architecture)** smoothly.

Affected Application: Automated Report System, **[Linamar Integrated Tool Management System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool_management)**, and Tool Tracker Focused **[Manufacturing Execution System](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/mes-system)**

Business Justification: The Avilla Structures Kubernetes Cluster will be used to run Structures Information System software such as the Automated Report System, **[Linamar Integrated Tool Management System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool_management)**, and Tool Tracker Focused **[Manufacturing Execution System](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/mes-system)**. These projects are for Linamar Structures as a whole but are currently serving Southfield, Albion, Avilla, and possibly Mills River.
