## Projects

- Automatic end-user requestable Excel from Plex ERP
  - **[End-user request kicks off scripts to extract data from the Plex ERP, transforms it, and then loads the result into a database table in the data warehouse.](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/)**
  - Produce Excel, archive result set, and email to end user.
- **[Tool Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool_management)**

  Move away managing tooling in Excel and the Busche Tool List to a more rubust and easy to use system.
- **[Tool Tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_execution_system)**
  Automatically collect cnc,job, and start/end tool operation times for problematic tooling.
- **INC0417507 - Excel VBA to Power BI**

  I suggest we migrate this VBA Excel program to a Web App, SQL database, and Power BI. The downside to this suggestion is that it would take some time. The upside is that the Web App can perform validation on the dates and other information before being saved to the database. Using VBA it is easy to create complex programs to solve business needs quickly, but it is difficult to make these programs robust.
- Linus **[Platform](https://platformengineering.org/blog/what-is-platform-engineering)** and **[Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/sre/#:~:text=Site%20reliability%20engineering%20(SRE)%20teams%20collect%20critical%20information%20that%20reflects,application%20responds%20to%20a%20request.)**
  
  - Research and make recommendations to improve platform reliability.
  - Use MicroK8s on-prem cluster for research and testing.
  - Prove **[security](https://www.infracloud.io/blogs/request-level-authentication-authorization-istio-keycloak/)**
 and reliability of **[Azure AKS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/what-is-aks#:~:text=Azure%20Kubernetes%20Service%20(AKS)%20is,of%20that%20responsibility%20to%20Azure.)**.

## Azure resources

- **[Azure AKS Entra ID managed cluster](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/enable-authentication-microsoft-entra-id)**
  - ~ $350/month
  - Our current cluster uses one **[Standard_D8_v3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/general-purpose/dv3-series?tabs=sizebasic)** VM which has 8 vCPU and 32 GB ram.
  - Second resource group. When you create a new cluster, AKS automatically creates a second resource group to store the AKS resources. For more information, see **[Why are two resource groups created with AKS?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/faq#why-are-two-resource-groups-created-with-aks)**

- **[Fully Mangaged Azure SQL Database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/sql-docs-navigation-guide?view=sql-server-ver16#applies-to)**
