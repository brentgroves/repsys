## Research

A list of all research for repsys.

- **[What is IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)?  Understanding the Key Metric for Storage Performance](../../../research/m_z/storage/iops.md)**

  When measuring the performance of storage devices, one key metric often used is IOPS or Input/Output Operations Per Second. This metric provides an important measure of how fast a storage device can read and write data, which ultimately affects its overall performance.

- **[Sessions and Cookies](../../../research/m_z/virtualization/networking/http/session_and_cookies.md)**

  When a user logs into the website, a session is created. In this session, you can created variable called “session variable” that store data in a key/value format ( like cookies ).

  This session is associated with a randomly generated unique ID, which is created by the server. It’s called “session ID”.

  The generated session ID is then sent to the user’s browser and stored as a cookie, while the session data is stored on the server-side.

  Now, when the browser send a request to the server, it’ll send the cookies with the request.

  The server will receive the cookie from the incoming request and retrieve the value of the session ID.

  Afterwards, the server will search for the session and retrieve all the data stored within it once it is found.

- **[Learn Microservices using Kubernetes and Istio](../../../research/a_l/istio/learn_microservices_with_istio_on_k8s.md)**

In short, the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery. There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies.

## Important date

March remove active directory.  

## Dan Martin Status

Give Dan monthly status report of progress on the TB part of the report system.

50% done.  Estimated completion date Feb.

## Tickets

The goal is to nail down the details of where the various parts of our report system will be running.

- Can we still use Mobex tenant after March for **[AKS, Azure SQL db](../tickets/azure_resources.md)**? How are we currently paying for these resources? If we can keep them we probably need to continue to pay for an E5 developers license as well as the AKS and Azure SQL Server resources which are appoximately $300 per month.
- Request AKS and Azure SQL server so that we can put the report system requestor and archive viewer in a teams tab?
- Request a GPO to distribute our intermediate and root certificates to the trust stores of IT/OT hosts that will be accessing Mach2 or our reporting system?
- Request to register our report system Oauth2 app in linamar azure tenant?

## PKI

- Internal Certificates (Self-Signed) - Aamir gaffar
- DigiCert - John Biel
- Our PKI

## **[Network Upgrade Request for the Reporting System](../jdavis/network_upgrade.md)**

- 60 static IP addresses.
- 8 network cables ran to each R620 currently I only have 3.
- New gateway address
- New name server addresses
- Need to be physically on the servers to change the IPs.
- I completely wipe these R620s occassionally so I would like a key to the server room.

## Important Windows VMs

- alb-utl.busche-cnc.com (10.1.1.150) has ETL ssis scripts which we run from Visual Studio
- alb-utl4 (10.1.1.151) Power BI Report Builder
- busche-sql.BUSCHE-CNC.com (10.1.2.74) Busche Tool List for the Busche Reporter.

## Azure SQL MI

Add new home public IP4 and IP6 address and our Linamar vlan's public IP to the database firewall rules if different than current IP.

My Public IPv4:
64.184.116.66
My Public IPv6:
2605:7b00:201:e540::787
My IP Location:
Ligonier, IN US
My ISP:
Ligonier Telephone

## 3 Dell PowerEdge R620s

Each Dell PowerEdge R620S has 132 GB of RAM so each can run a 4 node K8s cluster with the report system installed.  Two can be used for production and backup report system deployments. The third can be used for Albion or home development.
