## Research

- **[Research List](../../../research/research_list.md)**\
A list of all research for repsys.

- **[Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery(CI/CD)](../../../research/a_l/continuous_integration_and_delivery/continuous_integration_and_delivery.md)**
Semaphore lets you test and deploys code at the push of a button with hosted continuous integration and delivery. After you push code to GitHub, it quickly runs your tests on a platform with first-class Docker support and 100+ tools preinstalled.

- **[Zitadel](../../../research/m_z/zitadel/zitadel.md)**\
ZITADEL is an open source, cloud-native Identity and Access Management solution (IAM) that provides various security mechanisms to secure applications and services. It uses a range of different authorization strategies, including Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Delegated Access.

- **[Juju](../../../research/a_l/juju/tutorial.md)**\
  Juju provides a declarative and model-driven way to install, provision, maintain, update, upgrade, and integrate applications on and across Kubernetes containers, Linux containers, virtual machines, and bare metal machines, on public or private cloud.

- **[Mattermost](../../../research/m_z/mattermost/mattermost.md)** \
  Mattermost is an open-source, self-hostable online chat service with file sharing, search, and integrations. It is designed as an internal chat for organisations and companies, and mostly markets itself as an open-source alternative to Slack and Microsoft Teams. Wikipedia

- **[Minio Object Storage](../../../research/m_z/minio/minio.md)**\
  Object storage is accessed via a REST API call. Using POST, PUT, GET to an HTTP endpoint, you can create, read, update and delete (the famous CRUD operations) your blobs of data.
