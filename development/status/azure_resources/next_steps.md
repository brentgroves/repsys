### Stop your cluster

AKS just recently introduced a new feature to **[stop and start a Kubernetes cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/start-stop-cluster)**. Until we start running reports and we complete the the Tool Management and Tracker software, we can stop it often. 

To stop the cluster, it is as easy as running:

```bash
$ az aks stop \
    --resource-group <resource_group> \
    --name <aks>
```

Our cluster may cost a little more but this stopped cluster only costs $4.05USD per week. Thatâ€™s only $0.58USD per day!
