# what is an oci image

An OCI (Open Container Initiative) image is a standard, portable format for packaging and distributing container applications, defined by the OCI Image Specification, which includes an image manifest, configuration, and filesystem layers.

Purpose:
The OCI Image Specification aims to enable interoperability between different container tools and runtimes, ensuring that container images can be built, transported, and run consistently across various platforms.

Components:
Image Manifest: Contains metadata about the image, including references to the image configuration and filesystem layers.
Image Configuration: Includes information like application arguments, environment variables, and execution parameters for creating a container.
Filesystem Layers: A set of filesystem archives that form the image's content.
Image Index (Optional): A higher-level manifest containing file descriptors to architecture-specific image manifests.
Benefits:
Interoperability: OCI images are designed to be used with various container runtimes and tools, ensuring consistency and portability.
Standardization: The OCI Image Specification defines a common format for container images, making it easier for developers and operators to work with them.
Efficiency: OCI images can be built and distributed efficiently, leveraging techniques like layered images and content addressing.
Example:
The Ubuntu container image is an example of an OCI-compliant image.
OCI and Docker:
Docker is one of the implementations of the OCI, but there are other implementations as well.
OCI Specifications:
The OCI currently contains three specifications: the Runtime Specification (runtime-spec), the Image Specification (image-spec) and the Distribution Specification (distribution-spec).
