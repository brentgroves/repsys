Request: RITM0187718

We have been tasked with setting up a Kubernetes cluster for the Structures department's use. This cluster will be secured with mTLS using Istio when running in production but during its initial setup, we ask for 1 week of unrestricted internet access. Justin Langille requested that I complete a list of all domains needed when the cluster is operational, so I added that as an attachment to this request. This project will take more than 1 week to set up so we will ask for more time with unrestricted access at a future date. Thank you.
