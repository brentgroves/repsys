# Help with K8s

Christian Smith: Global Directory IT
Adrian Wise: System Admin, Technical Services Manager.

Thanks again for considering me for the Kubernetes, K8s, position!

To me K8s is the ultimate platform and I love working on it.

One good thing about k8s is its **[observability](https://www.groundcover.com/blog/kubernetes-observability)**. Applications designed for K8s collect **[time-series data](https://www.tableau.com/analytics/what-is-time-series-analysis)** into a **[promethesis](https://prometheus.io/)** time-series database.  Once this data is collected you make dashboards in **[grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/)** to monitor each application.

I know you are trying to fill a position and are probably under a considerable amount of pressure to get the right person for the job.  I don't know if I'm the right person for the job, but I could trouble-shoot each application and see if we could figure out how to make the platform(s) more robust. Don't know if I could help, but would love to give it a try.

Sincerely yours,
Brent
