# Install K9s

- I have not used K9s much.  It could be helpful but I suggest learning kubectl first to make sure you know what K9s is doing.

**[Install K9s](https://k9scli.io/topics/install/)**

## Via LinuxBrew

- This works but the snap install did not install k9s in /snap/bin but it did install config files in /var/snap/k9s

brew install derailed/k9s/k9s

issue: don't know where the config.yaml file is whis probably because the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME variable is not set.

```bash
# ls: cannot access '/k9s/config.yml': No such file or directory
ls $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/config.yml                                                                   
```

## Via Snap (Dont use this way)

DOES NOT INSTALL THE BINARY AT /snap/bin for some unknown reason.
