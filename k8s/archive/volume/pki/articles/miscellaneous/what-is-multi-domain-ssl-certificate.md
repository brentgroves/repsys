What is Multi Domain SSL (SAN) Certificate?
Multi domain (SAN) is a built-in feature that comes with an SSL certificate which lets users secure multiple domains under a single certificate. Depending on the certificate authority, a user can secure up to 250 domains under a single multi-domain SSL certificate. Securing multiple domains using SAN certificate saves money and SSL management time. Certificate authorities (CAs) such as DigiCert, Thawte etc. allow users to add up to 25 domains.

Multi-Domain/SAN SSL Certificate Structure
Under a multi-domain SSL, the first domain is considered as primary domain and other domains are considered as SAN (Subject Alternative Names) domains. For example, if a user wishes to secure five different domains under a single certificate, the first domain which was added during SSL signup process will be the base domains and other 4 domains will be considered as SAN domains. A multi-domain SSL can be availed with domain validation (DV), organization validation(OV), and extended validation(EV).
In case of DV, the verification process will be completed by verifying domain-registrarâ€™s information or via email/file based verification. Whereas in a case of OV and EV, the verification process involves validating business and personal documents. Here it is worth noting that document requirement policy may differ from one CA to the other.

Mostly all the certificate authorities(CAs) offers unlimited number of server licenses with each SSL certificate. It means that a user can secure his/her domain(s) on unlimited number of servers. A few certificate authorities have come up with single server licenses. In this case, the user needs to purchase an additional license for every additional server.

Domains a SAN SSL certificate can secure
Under a single multi-domain SSL certificate, a user can secure any number of domains. The examples of multi-domain are given below.
www.domain-name.com
domain-name.com
domain-1-name.net
blog.domain-name.com
anything.domain-name.com
etc.
