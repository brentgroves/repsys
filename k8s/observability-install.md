# MicroK8s Observability

**[microK8s Observability](https://betterprogramming.pub/observability-with-microk8s-14c1f0ff5183)**

Microk8s has an observability stack built-in. But it still requires some set-up and finessing, which I will review in this article.

To follow along, you should have microk8s installed, and I will use k9s for cluster visibility. You can use Lens, but I like k9s for its simplicity. In my Kubernetes cluster, I have a few microservices and databases running. Going on k9s, I see this:

To install the observability stack, you can run this command:

microk8s enable observability
Infer repository core for addon observability
Addon core/dns is already enabled
Addon core/helm3 is already enabled
Enabling default storage class.
WARNING: Hostpath storage is not suitable for production environments.
         A hostpath volume can grow beyond the size limit set in the volume claim manifest.

Note: the observability stack is setup to monitor only the current nodes of the MicroK8s cluster.
For any nodes joining the cluster at a later stage this addon will need to be set up again.

## How to configure install

<https://github.com/canonical/microk8s-core-addons/issues/125>

Yes can use microk8s enable observability -f values.yaml command to deploy your own custom config.
For values.yaml file, you can read more detail on this.

I assume you familiar with helm chart and values file.

I ended up abandoning the addon and just installing its constituent parts myself. Ultimately it ended up being better for me.

Yep, cause without documentation there's no point.

## port forward

<https://www.server-world.info/en/note?os=Debian_12&p=microk8s&f=8>

```bash
# set port-forwarding to enable external access if you need
# Prometheus UI
root@dlp:~# microk8s kubectl port-forward -n observability service/prometheus-operated --address 0.0.0.0 9090:9090
Forwarding from 0.0.0.0:9090 -> 9090
# Grafana UI
root@dlp:~# microk8s kubectl port-forward -n observability service/kube-prom-stack-grafana --address 0.0.0.0 3000:80
Forwarding from 0.0.0.0:3000 -> 3000
