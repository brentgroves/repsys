## Kong, NGinx, or nodeport

I believe both can be made to run at the same time but have not tested that.

- **[Kong](./metalb-kong-install.md)** is an API server and has features such as throttling and IAM and uses the newer K8s Ingress technology and is built on top of NGinx. There are **[2 ways to install](./kong/)** this of which the experimental install adds additional functionality and features not a part of the standard install.

- **[NGinx](./metalb-ingress-install.md)** alone can take care of secure TLS certificate connection.  If you use it there is a way to pass-through TCP such as that used by database connections.

- Nodeport can be used to pass-through any TCP data and can be used to access MySQL or other database. Nodeport can be used no matter which Ingress Controller you select.

## Ingress

Providing external WSS connections to Mosquitto can be achieved with an ingress such as the following. With cert-manager and a certificate issuer such as Letâ€™s Encrypt, SSL certificates can be automatically obtained at deployment, enabled WSS connections via wss://mqtt.example.com

## **[AKS Ingress](../research/a_l/azure/aks/ingress_controllers.md)**

Microsoft recommends thier application routing addon which works with their DNS Zones and Key vault.  I may use it later but will try to configure the standard **[NGinx Ingress](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/)** first.

**[Install Nginx Ingress](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#azure)**
Make separate install document.  Thank you Lord for giving me peace today and everyday that I follow you!
