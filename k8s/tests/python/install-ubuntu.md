# pyodbc issue
when running:python odbc-dsn-plextest.py from
/home/brent/src/linux-utils/odbc
would get a segmentation fault when using pyodbc installed with conda
to fix the issue i ran: conda remove pyodbc
then checked pip list:
if pyodbc was not installed then I ran: pip install pyodbc.
after this running:python odbc-dsn-plextest.py caused no errors.

I'm on Ubuntu 20, PHP 7.4 FPM, nginx.

Server Microsoft SQL Server [11.00.3128 Microsoft SQL Server 2012 (SP1) - 11.0.3128.0 (X64) Dec 28 2012 20:23:12 Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation Standard Edition (64-bit) on Windows NT 6.2 (Build 9200: ) (Hypervisor) ]

When I:

openssl s_client -connect myserverip:1433 -tls1
I get:

CONNECTED(00000003)

It's nothing to do with the TLS protocol version. When SQL Server gets installed it is configured with a self-signed X.509 certificate. If you want to use encrypted connections (with Encrypt=yes; in the connection string, which is the default now) you'll either need to 1) get the X.509 certificate's public key from the server and add it to your trusted certificates store on the client or 2) use the TrustServerCertificate=yes; setting in your connection string. â€“ 
  conn = pyodbc.connect('DSN=cm18;UID='+username+';PWD='+ password + ';TrustServerCertificate=yes;DATABASE=cribmaster')

From a stackoverflow question:
"When SQL Server gets installed it is configured with a self-signed X.509 certificate. If you want to use encrypted connections (with Encrypt=yes; in the connection string, which is the default now) you'll either need to 1) get the X.509 certificate's public key from the server and add it to your trusted certificates store on the client or 2) use the TrustServerCertificate=yes; setting in your connection string."
In addition to adding TrustServerCertificate=yes; to the connection string I had to lower the default security level from 2 to 0.
sudo vi /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf
# this is for driver 18 not 17
[system_default_sect]
# CipherString = DEFAULT:@SECLEVEL=2
CipherString = DEFAULT:@SECLEVEL=0

was having the same problem trying to connect from PHP 8.1 in a Ubuntu 22.04 server to a Microsoft SQL Server 2014.

OpenSSL 3.0 (which comes with Ubuntu 22.04) changed the default behaviour of SECLEVEL. Now you need to specify 0 instead of 1. More info here: https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/17476
https://askubuntu.com/questions/1233186/ubuntu-20-04-how-to-set-lower-ssl-security-level

Two different things fixed the problem for me:

As explained above, in /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf

Change:

[system_default_sect] CipherString = DEFAULT:@SECLEVEL=2

To:

[system_default_sect] CipherString = DEFAULT:@SECLEVEL=0

Also, when establishing the connection in PHP (and I imagine the same would work in Python too) to the SQL server, add the following options:

"Encrypt"=>true, "TrustServerCertificate"=>true

verify if unixODBC is installed 
which odbcinst 
which isql 

Test if the connection via ODBC Driver is working.

#isql -v <YOUR_DSN> <user> <password>
# not yet cm not in /etc/odbc.ini file 
isql -v cm sa buschecnc1
conda install -c conda-forge unixodbc # I don't know if we need this it is not in the dockerfile
# maybe we only need it if we don't use DSN

My dotfiles has this in the path already.
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/opt/mssql-tools18/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

cd ~/src
git clone git@github.com:brentgroves/linux-utils.git 
cd ~/src/linux-utils/odbc
Dont need to extract driver
tar -xf PROGRESS_DATADIRECT_OPENACCESS_OAODBC_8.1.0.HOTFIX_LINUX_64.tar
install ksh already installed in 22.04 desktop
sudo su
ksh unixpi.ksh  
Press the space bar around 50 times to get through the license.
Install will ask you for the following which I got from the linux drivers from Plex. (KEY = 35057920,COMPANY = BPG-IN,SERIAL = 004193623) 
This is how the docker file does it. 
message = '\nYES\n\n\n35057920\nBPG-IN\n004193623\n35057920\n\n'
run( [ 'ksh', 'unixpi.ksh' ], input=message.encode() )
exit out of root.
then update the /etc/odbc.ini and /usr/oaodbc81/odbc64.ini files with what is stored in the ETL-Pod dockerfile 
The dockerfile looks like this:

cd ~/src/linux-utils/odbc
sudo cp ./odbc.ini /etc/
cat /etc/odbc.ini
odbc64.ini already had stuff in it but i deleted it and copied the file in this directory
which contained the original content plus Plex and PlexTest entries.
sudo rm /usr/oaodbc81/odbc64.ini
sudo cp ./odbc64.ini /usr/oaodbc81/
cat /usr/oaodbc81/odbc64.ini 
The environment variables need to be set before any connection will work.
The docker file does this:
ENV LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/oaodbc81/lib64"
ENV OASDK_ODBC_HOME="/usr/oaodbc81/lib64"
ENV ODBCINI="/usr/oaodbc81/odbc64.ini"
But these entries are already set in my dotfile.
You can:
source oaodbc64.sh script which exports common unixODBC environmental variables if the dotfiles have
not been installed yet.  
run odbcinst -j to verify the environmental variables were set.
Should look like this:
unixODBC 2.3.9
DRIVERS............: /etc/odbcinst.ini
SYSTEM DATA SOURCES: /etc/odbc.ini
FILE DATA SOURCES..: /etc/ODBCDataSources
USER DATA SOURCES..: /usr/oaodbc81/odbc64.ini

SQLLEN Size........: 8
SQLSETPOSIROW Size.: 8

cd ~/src/linux-utils/odbc
conda activate reports
run "python odbc-dsn-plextest.py" to verify connection is ok.
