## install

```bash
sudo snap install nmap
sudo apt-get install nmap -y
```

## In-Use IP addresses

nmap -sP 10.1.0.0/22

## timestamp requests

A live host will send back a reply, signalling its presence on the network. Using the -PP option, Nmap will send ICMP timestamp requests (type 13), expecting ICMP timestamp replies (type 14) in return. If a type 14 ICMP packet is received, then Nmap assumes the host is alive.

```bash
sudo nmap -PP repsys13

[sudo] password for brent:

## in use ports

Once the installation completes, you are ready to scan your LAN with nmap. To find out what addresses are in use, issue the command:

nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24
nmap -sP 172.20.88.0/22
nmap -sP 10.1.0.0/22
nmap 172.20.88.115
<https://172.20.88.115-118>

Note: You will need to alter the IP address scheme to match yours.

The output of the command (Figure B), will show you each address found on your LAN.

sudo nmap -vv -sS -O -n 172.20.88.0/22

While this simple command is often all that is needed, advanced users often go much further. In Example 4.3, the scan is modified with four options. -p0- asks Nmap to scan every possible TCP port, -v asks Nmap to be verbose about it, -A enables aggressive tests such as remote OS detection, service/version detection, and the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE). Finally, -T4 enables a more aggressive timing policy to speed up the scan.

nmap p0- -v -A -T4 172.20.88.115

## locate dhcp server
