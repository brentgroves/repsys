## Why MicroStack?

Install OpenStack anywhere in a few simple steps and let Kubernetes operators manage it for you. MicroStack (based on Sunbeam) is not yet another OpenStack on Kubernetes. It is a canonical OpenStack with native Kubernetes experience.

## Lucid interface

MicroStack is the most straightforward OpenStack ever. It installs in minutes through a friendly interface, making OpenStack fully accessible to those with no previous experience. Just give it a try and see whether OpenStack is suitable for you.

## MicroStack comes with a K8s-native architecture

This includes OCI images for OpenStack control plane services wrapped with Kubernetes operators for streamlined lifecycle management

## OpenStack for small-scale cloud environments

Private cloud infrastructure at a micro scale

OpenStack private cloud implementation used to be challenging due to its complexity and scale. This is no longer the case.

MicroStack enables enterprises to quickly deploy fully functional cloud infrastructure that serves as a cost-effective alternative to VMware vSphere, Citrix Hypervisor, Hyper-V and Proxmox Virtual Environment.

## For large-scale deployments, try Charmed OpenStack â€º

OpenStack for cloud providers
Open source equivalent to AWS Outposts and Azure Stack

Cloud providers who operate an OpenStack public cloud usually need an extension of their infrastructure running on customer premises for privacy and data sovereignty reasons.

MicroStack answers these needs, delivering an out-of-the-box cloud solution with native OpenStack APIs that can be easily installed or shipped pre-installed to end users.
