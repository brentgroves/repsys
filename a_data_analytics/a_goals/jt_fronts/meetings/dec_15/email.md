# Marposs Questions

Hi Brian and Bill. I would like to verify that it is not possible to collect parameters with a radio button or a multi select tag or a similar contol. Are parameters limited to free form text only?  Would Larry Becker be the one to ask?

The reason why I'm asking is the dimensional data and parameters we are collecting is going into a database. Then the it will be used as a data source for several Power BI reports. If the data is not entered in the correct format we will have to go through a data cleaning process and possibly loose information.

Below is the UI controls I'm hoping will be available in the program.

Thank you,
Brent

## Dropdown Menus / Combo Boxes

A Dropdown menu (or Combo Box, Pull Down menu, Picker) gives you a list of items to select from. It’s a common element in forms, setting pages, and quizzes. Read our Dropdown Menu guidelines.

## Radio Buttons

Radio buttons allow users to select items from a list when only a single selection is valid. It’s the perfect element when there are less than about 6 options. Read our Radio Button guidelines.

## Checkboxes

Checkboxes allow users to select items from a list when multiple selections are valid. This is the right UI element for letting them also choose to select nothing. Read our Checkbox guidelines.
